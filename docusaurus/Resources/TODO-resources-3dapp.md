translate all markdown files in folder :
/Users/Apple/Documents/GitHub/NotionNext/docusaurus/Resources/new/todo

once finished then move to /Users/Apple/Documents/GitHub/NotionNext/docusaurus/Resources/new/finished

You I need to analyze the provided Markdown file and optimize it according to Docusaurus best practices, following the template provided. Let me break down the requirements:


0. don't use js script to process the work or precess markdown file, do it one by one.
1. Direct use picture link from original markdown file.
2. Optimize the Markdown for Docusaurus using features like Admonitions, Tabs, Create appropriate frontmatter etc.
(frontmatter with:
    ---
    title: ""
    description: ""
    keywords: []
    tags: []
    slug: /
    ---)
and Post structure:
   - top left is update time, format is: Last updated: Sep date 2025
   - Use a main banner image
   - Feature list using Docusaurus lists or Admonitions
   - System requirements section
   - Installation instructions with Tabs for different scenarios in a clear cable
   - Download links in a table format
   - Tags section
1. Translate the content to English
2. Ensure it follows Google EEAT SEO principles
3. Create a short filename that matches the slug(Google-SEO-friendly)
4. Keep the content exactly as is (just translate and style)
5. Generate frontmatter with title, description, keywords, and slug
6. Use Tabs for different installation methods if applicable
7. Keep the download links and remove a.relateed content b.any content with taobao and weibo link
8. Generate SEO-friendly tags
9.  remove Related content part.
10. first banner image is like: 
    ![Alt-Name](https://www.gfxcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.jpg)
11. Don't import {Admonition} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';
