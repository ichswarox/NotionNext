These videos will go over what tracking is, how to guide SynthEyes to work how you want it to, basic modeling for layout purposes, and animation to understand how things move in space as well as work with each other through constraints. Using SynthEyes and Maya, we'll cover a variety of shots each with their own problems and solutions, so if you are just starting out or have delved into other tracking software, this tutorial will help you get into SynthEyes and be able to efficiently and effectively track production shots or your very own footage.
