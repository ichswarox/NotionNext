Artlist's new LUTs collection is the result of careful work led by expert in-house colorists, who are passionate about making these LUTs as user-friendly and high-quality as possible. "We made sure they are optimized to work across a wide range of shots," says Dor Zammir, a Colorist at Artlist. "They're designed to enhance the footage, helping you achieve beautiful, professional results while minimizing the risk of harsh colors or contrasts."

Creating LUTs that elevate visuals without overpowering them is no small feat, and Dor's team dedicated months to this balancing act.
