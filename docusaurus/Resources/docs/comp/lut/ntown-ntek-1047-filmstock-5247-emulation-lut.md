## Workflow

- Use Base LUT for Canon C300 MkII c-log2 as base grading
- Apply NTEK-1047 LUT to achieve filmstock look
- Can also be applied on sRGB photos

## Image Characteristics

- Film gradation curve emulation with gradual highlights and shadow rolloff
- Strong dark reddish skintones like original filmstock from the late 70s
- Cross-Color bleeding Color-Matrix emulation
- Dynamic range limited to +3 stops and -6 stops from middle gray to emulate the iconic 5247 filmstock
- Original c-log2 exposed middle gray at IRE 60%, after BASE-LUT + NTEK1047-LUT middle gray shifts to IRE 40% to match film characteristics
