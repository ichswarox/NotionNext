## Overview

Phantom LUTs Mavic 3 Pro is a collection by professional colorist Joel Famularo developed for Mavic 3 drone users (Mavic 3 Classic, Mavic 3 Pro and Mavic 3 Pro Cine) to simulate ARRI Alexa color science and classic film stock appearance. This pack is highly recommended and offers significant learning and practical value.

## Features

- ARRI Alexa 709 color science emulation for DJI D-Log and D-Log M
- 5 ARRI LUT pack with creative variations
- 6 Film Emulation LUTs based on real film stocks
- Perfect for Mavic 3 series drone users seeking creative post-production options

## The 'Alexa Look'

A lot of Mavic 3 (Pro/Cine) users have expressed dissatisfaction with the colors from the camera. This LUT emulates the ARRI Alexa Mini using a tried and true process developed with Sony, Canon and Blackmagic cameras. The Alexa's color science is considered the gold standard for natural, accurate and beautiful colors as a starting point for grading.

:::info
These LUTs are designed to deliver:
- Organic, smooth and gentle highlight roll-off that mimics Alexa's highlight rendering
- Natural skin tones designed to render contrast levels on skin like an ARRI Alexa
- Naturalistic, organic and classic colors
- Rich but not crushed shadows suitable for low light and broad daylight scenes
- Commensurate exposure levels that don't shrink the dynamic range of the camera
