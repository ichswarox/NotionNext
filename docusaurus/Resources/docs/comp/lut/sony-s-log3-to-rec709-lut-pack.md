## üìå Usage Tips

:::caution[Important Exposure Note]
Adjust exposure before applying LUT if the clip is over/under exposed. The LUT is built on correct exposure principles from Sony's whitepaper. Matches camera view assist and exposure tools.
:::

The LUTs work with any Sony camera shooting S-Log3, but each camera also has small deviations in color. The pack includes camera-specific adjustments for Sony a1 II, Sony a7 IV, and Sony FX2, with more cameras being added over time.

For other Sony cameras, use the general S-Log3 LUTs in the parent folder for very accurate, neutral color.
