**SKINTONE_01**: Our everyday 3DLUT for beauty and good skin tone rendering. Perfect for achieving a film/neutral look with natural and rich color palette.

**SKINTONE_02**: A film-like vintage inspired look with cool/green highlights. Designed to keep natural warm skin tones and a nice highlight feeling. Can be used at 100% or on a 60% opacity layer for a more neutral look.

**SKINTONE_03**: Perfect to get a Fujifilm look without losing realistic highlights and natural skin tone rendering. Features slightly warm midtones and blue shadows with detail-conservative approach.

**SKINTONE_04**: Provides a very soft contrast look with amazing dynamic range. Features soft highlights but gives nice skin tone richness, similar to a cineon scan.

**SKINTONE_05**: The most contrasty 3DLUT. Perfect for achieving a film look without losing realistic skin tone rendering.

**SKINTONE_09**: Provides well controlled saturation feeling with crispy details on skin tones.
