## LUT Variations

**148:** A bold, stylized look with rich, moody tonesâ€”my personal favorite.

**219:** Perfect for twilight or blue hour scenes, adding depth and atmosphere.

**958:** A timeless black-and-white look reminiscent of classic 1950s cinema.

PowerGrades are plug-and-play tools for DaVinci Resolve. They're prebuilt color grading templates that instantly apply a cinematic look to your footage. But unlike LUTs, PowerGrades give you complete control over every adjustmentâ€”shadows, highlights, contrast, and moreâ€”so you can fine-tune every detail to make it your own. With CineVista, achieving professional dark/gritty color grades has never been easier.
