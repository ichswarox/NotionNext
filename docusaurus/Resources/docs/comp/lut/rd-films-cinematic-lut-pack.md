**D-LOG TO STANDARD â€“ 4 LUTs.**

**Drone Camera Shooting Settings:**
D-LOG, H265, 5K 30fps, Exposure Comp 0, Neutral WB.

In order to get a correct exposure and a cinematic motion blur you need to use ND filters preferably ND-PL (with polarization) and also make sure you expose correctly!

Do not overexpose if you shoot on manual settings because you will lose details in your bright areas such as skies or clouds!

Use Histogram to set the exposure correctly and also only shoot in D-LOG video format for the best dynamic range. You can also turn on Overexposure Warning and that will help with getting a correct exposure. If you shoot on Auto set the exposure compensation to 0 zero.
