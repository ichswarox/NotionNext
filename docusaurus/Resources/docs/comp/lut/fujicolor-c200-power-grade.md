### 03. Hong Kong Blue
The third LUT adds more film-like appearance to images while enhancing color density. The shadows lean toward blue, while highlights have a film-like green.

### 04. Amsterdam Silver
Reduces saturation of greens and blues while carefully adding more intense red tones to skin. This LUT is the most neutral of the 5 LUTs and uses traditional bleach bypass techniques.

A brand new look added to my color series. It brings a soft, movie-like beauty with a subtle green hue that complements the Powergrades I developed.



### Five Styles Compatible with Any Camera
All 5 styles are carefully crafted as LUT files - they work perfectly with any camera of your choice once your material is converted to REC709 format (Complete tutorial included)
