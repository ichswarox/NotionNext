## Overview

In this course, you'll learn the essentials of procedural generation in Houdini. This course will teach you how to build and modify environments using HDAs and shelf tools.

Explore methods for preparing meshes tailored for display in Solaris and rendering with Karma's powerful instancing system. Simplify scene creation in Solaris with direct USD export from the SOP context, freeing up time for detailed shader and lighting adjustments.

Taking it a step further, we explore using Copernicus, Houdini's powerful new procedural texturing framework. This will allow us to craft specific details. Combining this with Megascans textures to give us the ultimate control over our shaders.

## Course Breakdown

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="week1" label="Week 1" default>
We start off by having a look at an overview of the project and the various workflows covered in the course. Breaking down the components of the project we discuss the technical approaches to be able to achieve our goals. Then we dive into the Project setup to establish the base of our workflow.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="week2" label="Week 2">
We dive right in, starting with the center of the environment we create and build the main platform using procedural modeling. Here we will build a detailing shelf tool that will allow us to quickly apply the same setup to other components in the environment. Before finalizing the platform geometry we make sure it's setup correctly for rendering in Solaris. As part of this setup we build a HDA to quickly generate shaders using Megascans textures.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="week3" label="Week 3">
This week we dive into the main walkway setup for the environment. Starting off we build the base walkway that can be generated from curves. Then we establish the workflow for auto generating stairs based on curve angles.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="week4" label="Week 4">
Continuing with our walkways, we set up a base HDA that we will build on as we develop the walkways. Building the first components of the walkway we look at generating render ready instances for the top and side walls of the walkways. We then learn how to randomly instance the geometry onto individual primitives rather than copy to points.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="week5" label="Week 5">
Building on the walkways we look at generating the stairs geometry and how to instance them based on different angles. Adding to our HDA, we build a setup to generate bridges and archways. We finalize the walkways setup for exporting to USD for rendering.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="week6" label="Week 6">
This week we move onto building the other assets for the environment, we take advantage of some existing setups that we have established to help quickly build highly detailed render ready geometry.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="week7" label="Week 7">
This week we take a look at using this powerful procedural texturing toolset. Covering the basics, we learn how to layer up texture detail by compositing various operations together. We learn how to import geometry and attributes to enhance texture detail, finally assigning the textures to shaders and setting up parameters to get the most out of the details.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="week8" label="Week 8">
For the final week, we import our animated character and cameras we learn how to load them into Solaris. We finalize the Solaris setup, assigning shaders to our environment and taking a look at how to setup per shot lighting and render settings.
