## Overview

In this course, you'll learn the essentials of procedural generation in Houdini. Master the basics of Houdini with comprehensive training covering procedural generation, Solaris, Karma, and Copernicus.

This is a Side FX Certified VFX Course at Rebelway, perfect for beginners looking to learn Houdini from the ground up.

## Learning Objectives

- Master the fundamentals of Houdini
- Learn procedural generation techniques
- Understand Solaris and Karma rendering
- Work with Copernicus procedural texturing
- Build and modify environments using HDAs and shelf tools
- Prepare meshes for display in Solaris

## Course Curriculum

### Week 1: Project Overview
We start off by having a look at an overview of the project and the various workflows covered in the course. Breaking down the components of the project we discuss the technical approaches to be able to achieve our goals. Then we dive into the Project setup to establish the base of our workflow.

### Week 2: Main Platform Creation
We dive right in, starting with the center of the environment we create and build the main platform using procedural modeling. Here we will build a detailing shelf tool that will allow us to quickly apply the same setup to other components in the environment. Before finalizing the platform geometry we make sure it's setup correctly for rendering in Solaris. As part of this setup we build a HDA to quickly generate shaders using Megascans textures.

### Week 3: Main Walkway Setup
This week we dive into the main walkway setup for the environment. Starting off we build the base walkway that can be generated from curves. Then we establish the workflow for auto generating stairs based on curve angles.

### Week 4: Walkway Components
Continuing with our walkways, we set up a base HDA that we will build on as we develop the walkways. Building the first components of the walkway we look at generating render ready instances for the top and side walls of the walkways. We then learn how to randomly instance the geometry onto individual primitives rather than copy to points.

### Week 5: Advanced Walkways
Building on the walkways we look at generating the stairs geometry and how to instance them based on different angles. Adding to our HDA, we build a setup to generate bridges and archways. We finalize the walkways setup for exporting to USD for rendering.

### Week 6: Additional Environment Assets
This week we move onto building the other assets for the environment, we take advantage of some existing setups that we have established to help quickly build highly detailed render ready geometry.

### Week 7: Copernicus Texturing
This week we take a look at using this powerful procedural texturing toolset. Covering the basics, we learn how to layer up texture detail by compositing various operations together. We learn how to import geometry and attributes to enhance texture detail, finally assigning the textures to shaders and setting up parameters to get the most out of the details.

### Week 8: Solaris and Final Setup
For the final week, we import our animated character and cameras we learn how to load them into Solaris. We finalize the Solaris setup, assigning shaders to our environment and taking a look at how to setup per shot lighting and render settings.
