## Overview

Our latest project-based course will work through a scene over time from concept to completion, supplemented with discussion in our private Slack channel. Classes will be released weekly or bi-weekly, covering all aspects of the shot from footage prep to photogrammetry to animation, effects, and more.

:::tip
The classes will be led by a variety of artists who contribute to the shot, based upon their specialty in the field. Leading the overall project and many of the classes is Charles Chorein, a London-based VFX supervisor who has taught many courses for us over the years.
