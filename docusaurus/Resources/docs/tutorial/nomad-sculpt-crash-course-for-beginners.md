## Description

Nomad Sculpt is an incredible 3D sculpting application for iPad and Android tablets. If you're thinking about getting into 3D, there is no better time to get started than right now. In this beginner course we'll create a basic character to get you comfortable with 3D sculpting in Nomad.

Here is some of what we'll cover in class:

-   Basic character blocking and using primitives (basic shapes to create various parts of the sculpts)
-   Essential tools needed for basic sculpting and manipulating 3D meshes (3D meshes are just shapes or objects!)
-   Voxel remeshing, smoothing, and masking.
-   Lighting and coloring hour sculpt
-   Exporting a final render, and also exporting a turntable

3D has come a long way since a stand-alone desktop computer was the only way to create 3D art. While you can export your files to Blender or other 3D software, it's actually fun designing on an iPad or tablet with Nomad. The application does have more complicated and advanced functions, but those you will learn in time. The basics are fairly easy to learn, which makes the whole process a whole lot easier.

Not only can you recreate your 2D characters in 3D, but you can also export your sculpts as STL files for 3D printing. This is an easy going beginners class, so no pressure, or stress - just learning and creating fun 3D art. I look forward to seeing you in class!
