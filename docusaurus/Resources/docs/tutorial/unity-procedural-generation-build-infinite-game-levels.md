## Description

Want to **make game levels using procedural generation**? It's one of the most powerful ways to **create infinite, dynamic game worlds** without designing every single detail by hand.

Learn how to **code your own algorithms** and **build replayable levels** that feel fresh every time! No more designing every corner‚Äîlet the code do the heavy lifting!

You'll start by generating a dungeon layout with rooms and hallways. Using Scriptable Objects, you'll **customize layouts effortlessly**, making sure no two levels feel the same. Say goodbye to repetitive level design‚Äîyour game world will evolve with every play-through.

Next, you'll **turn your 2D layouts into a fully realised 3D game level**. We'll harness the power of the Marching Squares algorithm to create detailed levels with only 16 tiles. If you're a solo dev or working with a small team, this trick will save you heaps of time and effort.

Navigation is key, so we'll dynamically generate a NavMesh at runtime. This means your player can **seamlessly explore every new dungeon layout without breaking immersion**. Whether you're building an RPG or a roguelike, this skill will come in handy!

But what's a dungeon without loot and baddies? Using a rule-based system, you'll **populate your levels with treasure, enemies, and decorations**. You'll also learn techniques to prevent everything from looking too repetitive‚Äîbecause variety keeps players engaged.

Along the way, we'll **level up your C# skills** with advanced concepts like lambda expressions, expression-bodied members, and System.Linq. If you've got the basics of C# down and want to push your coding skills further, you're in for a treat.

This course is perfect for anyone who knows their way around Unity's UI, GameObjects, and Prefabs. If you can handle loops, classes, and variables in C#, you're ready to level up your skills with procedural generation.

By the end of this course, you'll have a robust system for procedural level design, plus a sharper understanding of advanced C# concepts. Ready to **apply these techniques to your own projects** and build infinite game worlds? Let's dive in and start coding!

## Target Audience

- Developers who know the basics of C# and Unity and want to learn advanced C# concepts to level up their coding skills
- Anyone who wants to learn about procedural generation approaches
