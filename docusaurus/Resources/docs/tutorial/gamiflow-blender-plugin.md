## Overview

GamiFlow automates many processes in the high-to-low poly workflow for game assets. With a single button click, you can regenerate low-poly, high-poly, and final game-ready meshes. Everything will be optimized, triangulated, and renamed for optimal results in Substance Painter. This is especially useful when you need to iterate on your game assets and keep your low and high poly versions in sync.
