## Description

**Want to create Blender animations that actually go viral â€” without spending weeks learning every button?**

Most Blender courses overload you with endless menus and technical theory. That's why so many beginners give up before they ever finish a project.

This course is different.

We'll focus on the most impactful skills: advanced **character animation** and **cinematic camera moves** â€” the same ingredients driving today's most viral short-form 3D content.

Here's what you'll master inside:

- **MASTER ADVANCED BLENDER WORKFLOWS** â€” Learn character rigging, animation, and cinematic cameras without overwhelm
- **BUILD CHARACTERS FAST** â€” Use Human Generator, Mixamo & free tools to create ready-to-animate characters in minutes

What makes me (Vlad) credible to teach this topic?

I've spent over a decade editing and animating videos for YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok â€” managing channels with millions of views and refining workflows that deliver results. I've spent years fine-tuning a creative system that works across platforms and formats, including Shorts video editing, TikTok video editing, and video editing for Reels. The strategies and tools I'm about to share aren't theoryâ€”they're exactly what I've used to help creators go viral, build audiences, and grow real results.
