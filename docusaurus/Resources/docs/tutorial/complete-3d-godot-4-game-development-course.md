## Description

Making 3D games can seem overwhelming at first — but with Godot 4, it's more accessible than ever.

This course will guide you through the entire process of building 3D games in Godot 4, from the very foundations to advanced systems used in professional projects.

Along the way, you'll create **five complete 3D games**, each designed to teach you new skills and techniques:

- **Sky Pogo** – an endless jumper where you'll learn physics, animation, UI, and persistence
- **Brick Stacker** – a physics-based stacking game, covering rigidbodies, lighting, and progressive difficulty
- **Granny's Capers** – a full 3D platformer with enemies, animation trees, particles, and custom editor tools
- **Space Ace** – an endless space shooter with visual shaders, object pooling, the strategy pattern, and immersive sound
- **Quack Lite** – a complete FPS inspired by Quake, featuring modular AI with finite state machines, a flexible weapon system, multiple enemy types, powerful effects, and performance optimization

We'll also take focused detours into **core skills** like GDScript programming, Godot's scene and node system, and input handling, so you can approach each project with confidence.

By the end, you'll not only know how to make games in Godot 4 — you'll have a **toolkit of reusable patterns, scalable systems, and visual effects** that you can bring into your own projects.

Whether you're brand new to 3D or coming from 2D development, this course will give you the skills to create complete, polished games from scratch!
