**Instructor Background**: Laura Ewing is a freelance illustrator and storyboarder with a passion for animation. As a young girl, she would spend hours watching documentaries and DVD extras of her favorite animated films, in disbelief that creating these stories was a real job. She went on to study Graphic Design, with a specialization in illustration, to then study Fine Art at The Florence Academy of Art in Italy, and obtained her Master's degree in storyboarding at Lightbox Academy. Her diverse experience in the industry includes working in-house at Smile and Learn, as well as working as a freelance artist for documentaries, pilot series, and publishing houses. She most recently worked on a storyboarding project for a live-action movie, which will be released in 2021 and for Madrid 2120 as a storyboard artist, which received this year's Goya award for best short animation.
