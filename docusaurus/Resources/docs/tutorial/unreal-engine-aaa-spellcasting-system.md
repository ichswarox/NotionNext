## Instructor

**Vlatko Chankulovski** - Unreal Engine Senior Gameplay and UI/UX Programmer

I'm an Unreal Engine Senior Gameplay and UI/UX Programmer.

After many years of experience as a game developer, I have successfully created 10+ Full games and 10+ game prototypes and counting.

**After completing my Courses, you will be able to create a fully functional, optimized and production-ready games!**

Here's why:

Many important things for game development are not being taught on Youtube and other learning platforms, and some of those things are Game Optimization and Best Practices.

That's why I've decided to address this problems and I've started creating Unreal Engine courses and Tutorials that will teach you how to create games with proper Blueprints and best practices.

I want to teach you how to understand the Blueprints, not just to copy from the videos and not knowing what those Blueprints are doing. You will actually learn how and why the Blueprints are working that way, so after finishing my Courses you will be able to create games without watching Tutorials non-stop.

I want to make YOUR Game Development journey as smooth as possible and to pass on my skills and knowledge to YOU who want to create high quality video games, and to people who are struggling to find proper courses on YouTube or elsewhere, and anyone who wants to improve their programming skills with Unreal Engine Blueprints.
