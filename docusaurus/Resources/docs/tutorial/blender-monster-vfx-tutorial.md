FxForge (Albin Thorburn) has released a "Blender Monster VFX Tutorial" on YouTube, demonstrating the workflow for creating a monster using Blender.


While the workflow for the low-poly mesh is a bit brute-force, relying heavily on remeshing, the video is a great reference for understanding how to quickly bring a concept to completion.

:::info A Refreshing Change
Lately, the Blender community has seen a lot of tutorials focusing on cute, anime-style characters. A timelapse of creature creation like this feels like a rare and valuable find, which is why we wanted to share it.
