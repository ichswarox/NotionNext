While the workflow for the low-poly mesh is a bit brute-force, relying heavily on remeshing, the video is a great reference for understanding how to quickly bring a concept to completion.

:::info A Refreshing Change
Lately, the Blender community has seen a lot of tutorials focusing on cute, anime-style characters. A timelapse of creature creation like this feels like a rare and valuable find, which is why we wanted to share it.

FxForge has published several other interesting videos, including one where they recreate an enemy from *The Last of Us* in a single day. If you find this interesting, be sure to check out their channel!
