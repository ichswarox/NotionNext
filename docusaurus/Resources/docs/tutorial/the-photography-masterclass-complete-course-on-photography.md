## Overview

This photography course changed this photographer's life...

"After more than 20 years of taking photos as a hobby, I decided that I wanted to know more about photography and finally leave "Auto-mode" behind me.

Should have done this much sooner: Chris explains everything in a simple manner but very thoroughly, and now; finally, all the puzzle pieces fall into place.

Great course, highly recommended."

Martijn Tilgenkamp
