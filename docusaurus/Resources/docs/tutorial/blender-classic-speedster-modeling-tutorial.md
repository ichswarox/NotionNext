:::tip[info]
Starting with Blender's basic modeling tools, build the basic shape of the car. As we progress, you will be exposed to more advanced tools and hard surface modeling techniques. Once modeling is complete, we will begin assigning materials and adding textures for leather seats and wooden texture steering wheels.
