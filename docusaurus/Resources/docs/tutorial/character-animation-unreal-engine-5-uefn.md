## Instructor

**Michael Ricks** - Animator, VFX Artist, Independent Filmmaker

I've been making films and doing visual effects on indie films for over 15 years. When I discovered Unreal Engine I was blown away by it's realistic real-time rendering engine! I immediately saw that Unreal Engine was a game changer and that it had now become possible for a small studio consisting of a few artists or even a single artist to pull off a Hollywood quality feature length animated film!

In the past it would take hours, if not days, to render each frame of animation, which made it impossible for an independent artist to complete a full-length film. It would literally take years to render all the frames of a movie.

All this has changed with Unreal Engine - the playing field has been leveled, and it is now truly up to the talents and skill set of the artist/storyteller to create their vision. No longer will you be held back due to limitations of technology.

Join with me as we begin a journey in using this awesome tool-set - I think you will find it not only fun but extremely satisfying on a creative level.
