:::

This beginner-first course is designed to remove the panic, clear the jargon, and give you a calm, repeatable workflow you can trust. No gatekeeping. No "you should already know this." Just you, and a clear path from blob to believable forms.

I'm an experienced video instructor with 35+ years as an illustrator/designer. I already have top-rated Procreate courses on the iPad, and I've taught thousands of creatives who swore they "weren't 3D people." Spoiler: they were. If you've ever enjoyed painting or sketching in Procreate, you already have the instincts for Nomad Sculpt- and that's what this course is: a gentle, structured start that builds genuine confidence.

## 💡 What Makes This Course Different

- **Workflow based, not just explaining tools.** You won't be dumped into a sea of buttons. We'll establish simple, dependable workflows that you can use for everything you make.

- **Learn by building, not just watching.** Instead of tool lectures, you'll create beginner friendly models step-by-step that turn concepts into muscle memory.

- **Beginner-safe pacing.** We start with the four tools you'll use most (Clay, Move, Flatten, Crease), plus Smooth, symmetry basics, and navigation. As your confidence grows, we layer in more Nomad tools—always in service of the workflow, never as random features.

- **A Mindset that actually helps.** You'll have permission to make a mess, restart without fear, and learn in small, satisfying chunks.

## 🎯 By The End, You'll Be Able To

- Navigate Nomad comfortably and set up a distraction-free interface
- Block out strong shapes, refine clean planes, and add crisp stylized accents
- Understand what's under the hood—vertices, edges, and quads—so tools finally "click"
- Use symmetry wisely (and break it when your model needs life)
- Export cleanly and know your next steps toward printing, painting, or game-ready workflows
