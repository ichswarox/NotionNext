## Overview

This Certification Course will cover the software Sketchup by Trimble, Inc. Sketching is the quickest way to visualize complex 2D and 3D ideas, and that's the basis of the 3D Modeling Software called Sketchup.

Sketchup is one of the most intuitive 3D surface modelers and has a friendly CAD Interface to help you create, develop and manage 3D projects. To become proficient in using the software, it's important to have a solid introduction, fundamentals for how it works, and some fundamentals of 3D Modeling in general, especially with regard to application in real world projects.

Whether you are a complete beginner or someone with a bit of experience; we cover everything from the very basics up to proficient use. The course has 8 Modules comprising all the subjects you must learn to understand how Sketchup works and how to design and document your Sketchup projects.

:::tip
Sketchup's motto is "3D For Everyone" and this is not an understatement. Sketchup is easy to learn and grasp due to its simplicity and intuitive methods of form creation.
