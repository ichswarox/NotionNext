## Course Description

Master the complete architectural visualization and documentation pipeline using the industry's most accessible yet powerful software combination. This comprehensive course teaches you to create photorealistic visualizations and professional technical drawings through one complete single-family house project, demonstrating real-world workflows that practicing architects use daily.

### Integrated Architectural Software Mastery

This course focuses on the synergy between three essential architectural tools: SketchUp for intuitive 3D modeling, V-Ray 6 for professional rendering, and LayOut for automated technical documentation. Unlike courses that teach software in isolation, you'll learn how these programs work together to create a seamless workflow from initial concept to final presentation.

### Real-World Project Foundation

Work through an authentic two-story, 140-square-meter single-family house project - exactly the type of commission you'll encounter in professional practice. This realistic scale and complexity ensures you develop skills that transfer directly to your career, whether you're working independently or within an architectural firm.

### SketchUp Advanced Modeling Techniques

Discover SketchUp's full potential beyond basic modeling. Master efficient workflows for architectural detailing, complex geometry creation, and model organization that maintains performance even in large projects. Learn professional modeling standards that ensure your models are both visually impressive and technically sound for construction documentation.

### Strategic Plugin Integration

Expand SketchUp's capabilities with essential plugins that professional architects rely upon. Master BezierSpline for complex curved elements, FredoCorner for architectural filleting, Component Stringer for repetitive element placement, and Skatter 2 for sophisticated landscape development. These tools transform SketchUp from a basic modeler into a comprehensive architectural design platform.

### V-Ray 6 Professional Rendering

Harness the latest V-Ray 6 features specifically designed for architectural visualization. Master new tools like Enmesh for efficient repetitive geometry, procedural cloud systems for realistic skies, and Camera clipping for architectural sections. These cutting-edge features place you ahead of professionals still using outdated rendering techniques.

### Multi-Scenario Lighting Mastery

Create compelling visualizations across different times of day and weather conditions. Learn tested lighting setups that work reliably across various architectural projects - from warm morning light that highlights building details to dramatic evening scenes that showcase interior lighting design. These proven techniques eliminate the guesswork from architectural lighting.

### LayOut Professional Documentation

Transform your 3D models into professional construction documents using LayOut's automated drawing generation. Master scaled drawing production, line weight control, dimensioning systems, and print preparation - all generated automatically from your SketchUp model. This workflow eliminates redundant drafting while maintaining professional drawing standards.

### Advanced V-Ray Post-Production

Complete your visualization pipeline entirely within V-Ray using advanced post-production techniques that eliminate dependence on external software. Master Cryptomatte masking for precise element selection, color grading for mood enhancement, and professional finishing techniques that elevate your renders to portfolio quality.

## Who This Course Is For

- Architects and designers wanting to master complete project workflows from modeling to documentation
- SketchUp users ready to advance their skills with professional rendering and technical drawing capabilities
- Architecture students and professionals seeking to integrate visualization with construction documentation
