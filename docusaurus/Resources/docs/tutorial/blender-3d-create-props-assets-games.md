## Description

This course contains the use of artificial intelligence. Master the process of creating 3D game-ready assets with this practical and hands-on course. You will build three progressively more complex assets, repeating each stage of the workflow to reinforce your skills and improve your efficiency.

The course covers everything from references and modeling to advanced materials, rigging, animation, and exporting to game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine.

**What you'll do in this course:**

- **References & Planning:** Prepare before starting any model
- **Blocking:** Create accurate base shapes
- **Detailing:** Add complexity using Boolean tools and other techniques
- **Geometry Cleanup:** Optimize your model for game performance
- **UV Mapping:** Prepare the model for texturing
- **Edge Smoothing:** Achieve perfect shading with bevel nodes
- **PBR Materials:** Create realistic and optimized textures
- **Reusable Nodes:** Build your own edge wear detection shader for quick re-use
- **Advanced Texturing:** Add dirt, decals, and fine details
- **Rigging & Animation:** Animate one of your assets for in-game use
- **Exporting:** Prepare and send your models to Unity and Unreal

By the end of the course, you will have a solid workflow for producing professional, optimized, and game-ready 3D assets that look great in any engine.

**Who this course is for**

- Game developers and 3D artists who want to create high-quality, optimized assets for real-time engines
- Creators looking to improve their Blender skills and learn professional asset creation workflows
