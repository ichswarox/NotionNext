## Overview

Have you always wanted to learn how to draw? Are you struggling to get better at drawing? Often artists appear to have a magical ability to see something â€“ really see it â€“ and draw what they see near perfectly. In this specialist drawing class we'll delve into those seemingly magical skills and learn how to really look at a subject and draw it.

I've been teaching Learn To Draw classes for a few years now with lots of successful results. Through my teaching experience I've been able to develop and refine a series of classes to teach anyone to learn how to draw. In this course I've taken what works best and put it together in a five part course to take you from beginner to improver! Even if you've been drawing for a while you'll find useful skills and practice exercises to take your drawing to the next level.

## Instructor

**Emily Armstrong** is an artist and an art teacher. After finishing a Masters of Art & Design I returned to the simple joy of putting pencil to paper and just drawing. Since then drawing has become my passion as both an expressive art form and an enjoyable and mindful practice. In 2017, after 7 years of teaching art at university level I started my own school, The Pencil Room, where I teach drawing and painting classes and workshops. From here I developed The Pencil Room Online, to share my classes in a suitable format for online learning.

My approach to teaching drawing is to give my students the skills to draw anything they choose, rather than teaching the steps to drawing just one type of subject. My focus is on changing the way you look at what you see so that you perceive it in a way that can be translated onto paper. Once you can do this, you can draw anything with time and practice.

I love the simplicity of drawing and I value doodling from the imagination as much as realistic drawing. Art doesn't need to be serious, it can be simple and playful. Making art can be fun, challenging and therapeutic and it can change the way you see the world.
