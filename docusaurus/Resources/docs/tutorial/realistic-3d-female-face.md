## üí° Course Benefits

We'll be focusing on the face and clothing of the character but particularly the face since it's commonly the most complicated and important part. It'll allow us to talk about topics such as facial anatomy, micro detailing, garment retopology, and how to solve common texturing challenges you'll encounter in your work.

Covering the Full Process:
- We're starting talking about how to align reference in photoshop
- Facial Anatomy
- Then prepping our model in maya and importing it zbrush, covering all specific steps and settings
- From there we'll give the character skin details using tileable maps in combination texturingxyz maps
- You'll learn powerful techniques using Smart Masks to significantly speed up texturing
- Once our skin details are done, we're starting on the color map using fill layers, creating the color map one layer at a time
- You'll also understand how to create simple and powerful roughness maps to make your characters pop

Skin Shading Made Simple:
Having done the first pass on all the base maps, we're bringing the textures into Arnold, where we'll set up the skin shader. Skin shading can be an incredibly complicated process, so we'll be sure to make it simple and easy to understand. With a first pass of the skin shading done, this is the step where the character is coming together. We're also using the FlippedNormals Eye kit, to make the character feel truly alive.

Professional and Tested Texturing Workflow:
You'll learn a professional way of sculpting likeness, exporting maps in zbrush, texturing in substance painter, working with xgen in creating hair and look develop for skin and hair in arnold, covering both texturing in Painter as well as skin shading in Arnold. This is a fast and industry-proven way of working, giving you a solid framework for all your future characters.
