## Overview

Welcome to **"3ds Max â€“ Complete Guide to 3D Modeling & Rendering,"** a hands-on course designed to help beginners and aspiring designers master the powerful features of Autodesk 3ds Max. Whether you are diving into 3D modeling for the first time or aiming to sharpen your skills for interior design, architecture, or product visualization, this course covers everything you need to get started with confidence.

Through a structured learning path, you'll explore the 3ds Max interface, drawing tools, modifiers, and advanced modeling techniques. Starting with basic primitives and snap tools, you'll progress to real-world modeling projects like creating a staircase, and CNC jali patterns. Learn how to convert 2D shapes into 3D, apply precise selection methods, and use the powerful Editable Poly workflow.

This course also includes in-depth training on **VRay**â€”covering lights, cameras, materials, and rendering settingsâ€”empowering you to produce photorealistic visuals for presentations and portfolios. You'll work with real design elements like stainless steel, mirrors, bump textures, tile maps, and glowing materials, while learning professional rendering workflows.

Perfect for interior designers, architects, product visualizers, and students, this course provides a complete learning experience that bridges the gap between design imagination and digital execution.
