## Overview

Learn to design, route, and document professional wiring harnesses from 3D model to 2D drawings. This course covers the complete workflow for creating wiring harnesses in SolidWorks Electrical.

:::info What You'll Learn

- Master 3D Harness Routing: Efficiently route wires and cables in complex 3D assemblies using automatic and manual techniques
- Generate Manufacturing Documentation: Create professional, industry-standard drawings directly from your 3D models
- Perform Harness Flattening: Generate accurate 2D manufacturing drawings of the harness layout for the production floor
- Automate Documentation: Create precise Bill of Materials (BOM), Wire Lists, and Cut Lists with a single click
- Build the Wire Chart: Accurately document all wire lengths, terminations, and connections for quality control
- Work with Library Components: Insert and manage connectors, terminals, clips, and other components in your 3D models
- Complete a Real Project: Successfully design the entire wiring harness for a functional Battery Pack and understand the best practices for such applications

:::

## Requirements

- Computer with Solidworks installed with Electrical Add-in required.

## Target Audience

- SOLIDWORKS Users who want to specialize in electrical design
- Electrical Engineers and Technicians looking to bridge the gap between 2D schematics and 3D product design
