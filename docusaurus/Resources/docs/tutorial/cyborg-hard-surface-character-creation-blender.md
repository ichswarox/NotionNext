### Description

Have you ever wanted to create a character that feels like it belongs in a triple A game or sci fi film? This course gives you the complete roadmap to bring a cyborg character to life from scratch, covering every step of the pipeline from sculpting to final cinematic animation.

This is more than just a modeling tutorialâ€”itâ€™s a full character creation journey designed to help you build skills that studios and clients look for, while also giving you a polished portfolio piece to showcase your talent.

**Why This Course is Different**

Most courses stop at modeling or texturingâ€”but this one takes you all the way through the pipeline: sculpting, retopology, UVs, texturing, rendering, rigging, and animation. You wonâ€™t just finish with a static modelâ€”youâ€™ll have a professional-grade character that moves, animates, and renders beautifully for both game engines and cinematic projects.

By the end of this course, youâ€™ll have:

-   A fully realized cyborg character, complete with anatomy, armor, textures, and animations.
-   A portfolio-ready render in both game and cinematic formats.
-   The confidence and skills to repeat the process for your own original characters.
