When people say "fix it in post", this is what they mean.

Compositing is sort of like Apple TV -- in that it's very useful but can be difficult to explain and understand. So let's break it down into a problem --> solution explanation.

### The Problem

Rendering is always the bottleneck of a production pipeline due to the extended time required to render a CG animation. So when we commit to render a Blender animation, wait hours or days for it to finish, only to decide after the fact that we want the [metallic material] to reflect 50% less, our only choice is to make that change in the blender material, then render and wait again. This is where compositing comes in.

### The Solution

Someone had the brilliant idea to separate rendered elements - like objects, material color, reflections, blender lights, etc - so they could be tweaked individually after rendering. Now to continue with the previous example, we could reduce reflections by 50% with the compositor in 5 seconds instead of waiting hours to render the whole scene again. That's the meat and potatoes of compositing. We can take this blender basics workflow to our advantage.

And in this course we're going to explore how we can disassemble and reassemble a 3D render with Blender's Node Editor. CC Music: ["Outer Planet" by Robbero](http://ccmixter.org/files/Robbero/40603)

#### Chapter 1 - Pre-Render Dissassembly

The first step in the compositing workflow is to separate your 3D scene into its individual render elements.

#### Chapter 2 - Post-Render Reassembly

Once your separated elements are rendered out, we need to re-combine them using the Blender's Node Editor.

#### Chapter 3 - Treatment

The bread and butter of compositing is the ability to quickly tweak and perfect your image without waiting to render the scene again. This chapter covers some common treatment techniques.

I knew I was missing this course so much.

With this fairly short course your renders go from "Meh.. nice... i guess" to "dang... nice photo!"

Not much more to say. Just take the course, you will not regret it!
