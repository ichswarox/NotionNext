## Overview

Welcome to the Unreal Engine 5 Blueprint 2D Game â€“ Santa Flappy for Android course! If you've ever wanted to build and publish your own mobile game without writing a single line of code, this course is the perfect place to start.

In this project-based course, you'll create a fully functional 2D side-scrolling mobile game called Santa Flappy using Unreal Engine 5 and Blueprint visual scripting. Santa Flappy is no ordinary flappy-style game â€” it features stunning sky visuals, smooth gameplay, and multiple fun mechanics to keep players engaged.

Your main character, Santa, will fly through the air, jumping over deadly log obstacles while collecting coins. You'll also implement an exciting fireball ability that allows Santa to break obstacles in his path. The game includes a score-based level progression system with 20 levels â€” after reaching the target score in each level, Santa advances to the next one. You'll also build a coin system, unlock multiple Santa characters, and design an intuitive UI with menus and HUDs.

Everything is built using Blueprints â€” no coding required. You'll learn to handle touch input, create visual effects, package for Android, and even test your game on real devices.

By the end of this course, you'll have a complete, polished Android game and the skills to make many more. Whether you're a beginner or just curious about mobile game development in UE5, this course is a perfect hands-on starting point.
