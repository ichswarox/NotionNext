AnimDojo is a new online animation "gym" established to support artists with a basic understanding of Autodesk Maya to become industry-ready pro animators capable of meeting the needs of today's working studios. Created by Tom Box and Badar Badruddin from Blue Zoo, this innovative training program is specifically developed to address an industry-wide skills shortage in the animation sector.

## Philosophy

One of AnimDojo's core philosophies is to facilitate constant improvement as much as initial learning. The platform is designed not just for initial skill acquisition, but for continuous professional development in the animation industry.

> "AnimDojo provides animators with a method to gain additional skills to those covered in traditional learning settings. Simply put, there's a lot of work for animators out there, but not enough animators with the level of skill required to work at the speed and quality that the studios demand. We hope to change that with AnimDojo."
