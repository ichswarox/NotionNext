### Course Philosophy

:::note Focus on the "Why"
Unlike other environment creation courses, this course doesn't just teach you "how." Instead, it focuses on the **"why"** and the fundamental artistic theory. This approach helps you build a new skillset that can be applied to environment creation for games, films, and other visual arts.
