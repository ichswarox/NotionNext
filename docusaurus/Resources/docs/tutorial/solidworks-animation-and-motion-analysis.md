## Key Learning Areas

1. **Animation Fundamentals**: Learn all the basics and important terms of animation in Solidworks including key properties, timeline, how to change the animation, how to use dimensions to dynamic body deforming spring animation in Solidworks, and fps (frame per second).

2. **Motion Analysis**: Explore complex motion analysis topics including contacts (why we use contact in motion analysis, how to define its parameters), event-based motion analysis, different types of motor parameters and how to use them, path follow animation in Solidworks, four bar mechanism analysis, torque and power calculation in Solidworks, and graph plotting.

3. **Advanced Analysis**: Master graph plotting (different kinds of graph plotting like velocity, trace path, acceleration, displacement, and much more), friction force calculation (how to define friction, how to use mate to define friction, how to plot friction force on a graph), and how to control robot arm movement by using mate controller.
