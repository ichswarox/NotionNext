# AnimDojo: The Online Animation Gym

![AnimationUK-yy.webp](https://list.ucards.store/d/img/AnimationUK-yy.webp)

## Overview

**AnimDojo** is a new online animation "gym" established to support artists with a basic understanding of Autodesk Maya to become industry-ready pro animators capable of meeting the needs of today's working studios. Created by Tom Box and Badar Badruddin, co-founder and animation director at London's multi BAFTA-winning animation studio Blue Zoo, AnimDojo specifically addresses an industry-wide skills shortage in the animation sector.

AnimDojo is an online animation gym for learning by doing, where artists can build skills in-line with real-world, practical animation studio insight. Through regular mini-assignments, materials, peer review and the opportunity to have work critiqued by industry professionals, artists learn as they produce.

> "AnimDojo provides animators with a method to gain additional skills to those covered in traditional learning settings. Simply put, there's a lot of work for animators out there, but not enough animators with the level of skill required to work at the speed and quality that the studios demand. We hope to change that with AnimDojo."
