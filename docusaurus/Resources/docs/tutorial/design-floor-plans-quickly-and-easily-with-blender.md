## Overview

This comprehensive course teaches you how to use **Blender** to quickly create stunning **architectural floor plans**. You'll learn everything from basic to advanced point-to-point 3D modeling techniques, creating walls, furniture blocks, and organizing assets using the Asset Browser feature.

:::info[What You'll Learn]
- Basic to advanced point-to-point 3D modeling techniques in Blender
- Various techniques for creating walls useful for floor plans and architectural design
- Different methods for creating furniture blocks from scratch and importing from external DWG, DXF, and SVG files
- Use the Asset Browser feature in Blender to organize assets for quick use in different projects
- Camera settings and adding labels and dimensions to floor plans
:::

## Requirements

- A computer capable of running Blender application
- Have a standard mouse with a scroll wheel
- A full-size keyboard with a numpad

## Why Use Blender for Floor Plans?

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cost" label="Cost-Efficient">
Blender is free or more cost-efficient. With Blender, you can replace a lot of expensive tools, such as CAD software, image editing software, 3D modeling software, rendering plugins, and so on. Unlike web apps with limited features in free tiers, Blender provides unlimited professional capabilities at no cost.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="precision" label="Precision">
Blender is precise. Unlike many 2D vector graphic software that are not geared towards architectural drawings, Blender can handle measurement units precisely. The floor plans you create in Blender will be useful for conceptual drawings, client presentations, and as the basis for 3D modeling.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rendering" label="Fast Rendering">
Rendering a floor plan in Blender is insanely fast. You can render a 4K resolution in just a fraction of a second. The workflow for creating floor plans is also very fast due to features like the Asset Browser.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Asset Library**: Once you set up your furniture blocks and materials in the Asset Browser, you can quickly drag and drop assets into your scene. Most of the time when creating floor plans, you only need to create walls and floors.

2. **Import Capabilities**: You don't need to create all furniture blocks from scratch. You can download them from the web in DWG, DXF, or SVG formats.

3. **Line Effects**: You can easily generate a nice-looking line effect that has a hand-drawing feel to it using grease pencil strokes with a "line-art" modifier. You can specify thickness, colors, line styles, and more to match your own style.

## Who This Course Is For

- Architects and interior designers who need a free alternative software solution for designing floor plans
- Lecturers in architecture or civil engineering who want to quickly and easily create floor plans without paying expensive subscription fees
