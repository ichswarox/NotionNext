## Overview

This project-based course will teach you how to create photorealistic daylight, night, and cloudy renders step by step. You'll learn how to balance shadows, reflections, and color to achieve realism in Lumion using professional tricks that come directly from practice, not theory.

## What You'll Learn

- How to master Lumion 12 from zero, starting with beginner-friendly setups to advanced rendering workflows
- Create realistic daylight renders using effects like Real Sky, Skylight, Hyperlight, and Color Correction
- Build cinematic night scenes with warm artificial lights, reflections, and atmospheric effects
- Apply alternative night lighting techniques for different moods using Sun, Hyperlight, Lens Flare, and Depth of Field
- Design cloudy and overcast environments with fog, precipitation, and seasonal (autumn) color adjustments
- Control shadows, reflections, and exposure for balanced and natural-looking results
- Use advanced post-processing tools (Analog Color Lab, Bleach, Bloom, Gamma, Tint, Contrast, etc.)
- Work with layers and object management for seasonal and scene-based adjustments
- Enhance renders with Depth of Field, Handheld Camera, and focal length framing for professional composition
- Produce over 30+ test and final renders across different lighting conditions to build your portfolio
- Gain the skills to create high-quality architectural visualizations ready for clients and presentations

## Description

**Note:** The main difference in this course is that it's **project-based and built around real-world renders**. Every concept is taught through **hands-on projects and professional tricks** that come directly from practice, not theory.

- **Do you want to create photorealistic daylight, night, and cloudy renders step by step?**
- **Do you know how to balance shadows, reflections, and color to achieve realism in Lumion?**
- **Do you want to learn the exact tricks professionals use for cinematic moods in architecture renders?**

Lumion is one of the most powerful tools for **architectural visualization**, and in this course we'll go deep into **lighting workflows**. You'll learn how to set up scenes, control the atmosphere, and create **realistic interior and exterior renders** by mastering the full range of effects: daylight, night, alternative night moods, and cloudy skies. Every lesson builds toward **professional, portfolio-ready results** with clear explanations and test renders at each stage.

Headlines:

- **Daylight Lighting** with Real Sky, Skylight, Hyperlight, and Color Correction
- **Night Lighting** with warm lights, reflections, and cinematic moods
- **Alternative Night Setups** using Sun tricks, Lens Flare, and custom tones
- **Cloudy Environments** with fog, precipitation, and autumn effects
- **Shadows & Exposure** for depth, balance, and natural realism
- **Analog Color Lab & Color Correction** for stylized or realistic tones
- **Reflections & Materials** for glass, water, and wet surfaces
- **Depth of Field & Handheld Camera** for cinematic composition
- **Test Render Workflow** to refine every stage step by step

By the end of this course, you'll have the skills to **create professional photorealistic renders in Lumion 1, 12, and beyond**. Don't hesitateâ€”**ask me any question you want throughout the course.**
