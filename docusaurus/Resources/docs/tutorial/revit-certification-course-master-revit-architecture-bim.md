## Revit Certificate of Completion

This Certification Course will cover the software Revit Architecture which for years has been the industry-leading technology for BIM implementation in architectural projects. Whether you are a complete beginner or someone with a bit of experience; we cover everything from the very basics up to proficient use.

The course has 10 Modules comprised of all the subjects you must learn to understand how Revit works and how to design and document your BIM projects.

This course will give you a strong foundation in using V-Ray, allowing you to create high-quality, photorealistic images and animations. Additionally, knowing V-Ray will help you to be more competitive in the job market, as many companies in various industries use this software.

## BIM

Learn how to harness the power of BIM with Revit. Revit is a powerful tool that allows professionals and organizations to work more efficiently on their design and construction tasks while also capturing data throughout the process.

### Features

:::tip
**Better Collaboration and Communication**: Revit contains several tools that allow for sharing, collaborating, documenting and versioning that other technologies don't have. For example, BIM 360 ecosystem allows teams to share project models and coordinate planning, ensuring all design stakeholders have insight into the project.

:::tip
**Model-Based Cost Estimation**: Revit has different tools that allow for efficient quantifying and cost estimation that save time to focus on other valuable tasks. Including estimators earlier in the planning stage allows for more effective construction cost estimation among other benefits.
:::

:::tip
**Preconstruction Project Visualization**: Revit allows you to plan and visualize the entire project during preconstruction. Space-use simulations and 3D visualizations enable stakeholders to explore design options offering the ability to make changes before construction starts.
:::

:::tip
**Improved Scheduling/Sequencing**: Reduce project phase cycles and eliminating construction schedule setbacks. Revit allows design and documentation to be done simultaneously and easily make changes to adapt to new information such as site conditions.
