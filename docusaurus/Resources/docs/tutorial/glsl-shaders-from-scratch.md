## üë®‚Äçüè´ Your Instructor

Hi, I'm Simon. I'm an ex-Google Engineer, ex-graphics programmer.

Throughout my game development career, I specialized in 3D Graphics and optimization, and my time at Google was spent in optimization and leading the performance infrastructure for Chrome. I started my career in the early 2000's working on the original XBox and Playstation 2, so that's about 20 years of experience in total. I've been around.
