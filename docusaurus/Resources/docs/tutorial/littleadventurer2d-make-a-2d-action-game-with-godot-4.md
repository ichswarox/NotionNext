## Description

Hello, I'm Single-minded Ryan, a game developer and digital artist.

In this course, we are going to create a classic 2D platformer game, with high-quality game assets.

In the game you will control Andie, our little adventurer, to explore an ancient 2D world. You'll need to defeat the enemies and reach the portal at the end of the level to finish the game.

My goal is to create a visual-oriented course to make you feel like you are making a real 2D game from scratch.

**This course comes with a high-quality game asset package, including the player and enemy animations, VFX files, parallax backgrounds (some are animated), and a level TileMap.**

(sound & music not included at the moment)

Along this course, you'll learn everything you need to start your 2D platformer. From how to design the level using the AutoTile feature, how to control the 2D animations with the animatedSprite2D node, how to code the movement and the enemy patrol behavior, how to create the close-range attack and projectile systems, how to create the pick-up item and the VFX, how to create and control the game UI, all the way to how to export the game project into executable files.

I'll try to focus on every detail, but at the same time, it would be great if you have some basic experience with some programming language. You don't necessarily need to know anything about GDScript, but it helps if you understand some general programming ideas such as how variables and functions work.

By the end of this course, you will have a 2D platformer that you can show off to your friends.

Please enroll today, I'm looking forward to seeing you in the course.

**At the end of this course, you will be able to do things like:**

How to code in GDScript, which is Godot's built-in programming language
How to control the player's 2D movement
How to use the AutoTile system with the TileMap node

How to update the project from Godot 4.2 to Godot 4.4
How to load the next game level scene
How to create a Main Menu
How to pause the game
How to create the material blink effect (for attack feedback)
