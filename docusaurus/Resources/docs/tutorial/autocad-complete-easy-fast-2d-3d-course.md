## Description

This course provides a complete introduction to **2D and 3D drafting and design using AutoCAD software**, guiding learners from fundamentals to advanced techniques. You will start by mastering the **core drawing and modification tools**, then progress to building **complex 3D models, applying materials.** As an industry expert with years of experience, I've designed this course to teach you everything you need to know about AutoCAD in the shortest possible time.

You'll gain practical experience creating **floor plans, elevations, circuit diagrams, mechanical parts, and structural details**. You'll also learn how to **manage projects efficiently with XRefs, Sheet Set Manager, and advanced block creation**.

By the end of the course, you will be equipped with the skills to **take a project from concept to professional output**, whether your goal is to pursue a career in architecture, engineering, or design or to enhance your AutoCAD proficiency for certification exams and workplace advancement. **The versatile skills you'll gain in drafting, modeling, and visualization can be applied across multiple industriesâ€”including architecture, interior design, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and even product design.**

**Getting Started**

- Exploring the AutoCAD for Windows interface
- Setting up drawing units and navigation basics
- Understanding coordinate systems for accuracy

**Basic Drawing Skills**

- Drawing lines, rectangles, circles, arcs, ellipses, polygons, and splines
- Using drawing aids: grid, snap, ortho mode, and polar tracking
- Canceling, erasing, undoing, and grip editing
- Blending between objects with curves and splines

**Projects & Drawings**

- Draw floor plans, elevations, sections, site plans, and staircase details
- Complete a full residential building project from start to finish
- Develop sectional drawings and isometric views
- Prepare professional drawing sets and project submissions

**Core Tools & Editing Methods**

- Creating selection sets for precise editing
- Move, copy, rotate, scale, and array commands
- Trim, extend, stretch, lengthen, offset, mirror, and align
- Apply modification tools: fillet, chamfer, explode, and join

**3D Modeling & Solids**

- Create 3D models using solids, surfaces, and meshes
- Model complex 3D shapes, windows, doors, and roofs from scratch
- Use solid editing tools: extrude, revolve, loft, sweep, shell, slice, subtract, and union
- Apply UCS coordinates and dynamic 3D views
- Set up cameras, export views, and manage rendering workflows

**Customization & Efficiency**

- Create custom AutoCAD templates and dynamic blocks (doors, windows, furniture)
- Use Layer States Manager for color profiles and theme-based work
- Convert units of existing drawings with a single command
- Work with XRefs, Sheet Set Manager, and advanced annotation features
- Learn AutoCAD command shortcuts to speed up workflow

**Annotations, Layers & Layouts**

- Create and edit text using single-line, MTEXT, and custom text styles
- Format, transform, and manage paragraphs of text
- Work with dimensions, leaders, and annotation styles
