## Description

**Welcome to a structured method of animating a realistic human run cycle.**

This structured method can be applied to create _any humanoid run cycle, with a similar rig_.

Hello there,

In this course, you will develop the skills to animate a dynamic humanoid run using a clear, structured method designed to strengthen both artistic sensibility and technical execution. The focus is on building a run cycle through a disciplined, layered workflow that mirrors the way professional animators approach complex motion.

The process begins with establishing a strong and balanced base pose. From there, you will construct the sequence by adding nine key poses that define a natural, believable run cycle. Each stage is designed to emphasize clarity, precision, and control, ensuring that the animation develops with purpose rather than guesswork.

By the conclusion of the course, you will have produced a polished run cycle that demonstrates rhythm, strength, and personalityâ€”qualities that elevate an animation from functional to expressive. Beyond the poses themselves, you will learn to refine movement through curve editing, achieving smoother transitions and more nuanced motion. You will also practice effective use of the dope sheet to manage timing and maintain clarity across the workflow.

This structured approach will enhance both confidence and efficiency, sharpening your understanding of timing, spacing, posing, and anatomy in motionâ€”core skills that underpin professional-quality animation. Most importantly, this method is versatile and can be applied to creating any humanoid run cycle using similar rigs.
