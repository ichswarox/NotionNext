Are you looking to start your career in character design? Are you looking for a way to hone your digital art skills? In this course, you will learn how to digital paint in Adobe Illustrator. I'll walk you through the entire process from start to finish.

The techniques I'm using in this video series can be carried over into many other painting applications. The methods I'm using are particular to Adobe Illustrator. This video will focus primarily on how to digital paint in the broadest sense so we can apply the knowledge to any other process as we see fit.

Digital painting in Adobe Illustrator allows you to adapt your character design for many uses and sizes. Since vectors are scalable and do not pixelate when resized.
