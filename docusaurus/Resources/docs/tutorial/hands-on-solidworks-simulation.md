## Overview

This hands-on course teaches the fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis using **SOLIDWORKS Simulation,** starting with clear concepts of how parts deform, vibrate, and buckle, then moving into practical tools and workflows. You will set up static, frequency, and buckling studies, create reliable meshes, apply loads and fixtures, define bonded and contact conditions including remote loads, run solutions, and interpret results such as von Mises stress, displacement, factor of safety, mode shapes, and buckling factors.

:::info What You'll Learn

- Perform static, frequency, and buckling simulations in SOLIDWORKS
- Solve truss, beam, shell, and solid element problems hands-on
- Prepare for CSWA & CSWP Simulation exams with practice cases
- Interpret results to guide design decisions with confidence

:::

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of engineering or mechanical concepts is helpful but not required
- Access to SOLIDWORKS (Standard, Premium, or Student Edition) with Simulation add-in
- A computer capable of running SOLIDWORKS smoothly

## Target Audience

- Engineering students preparing for CSWA & CSWP Simulation certification
- Mechanical engineers who want to apply SOLIDWORKS Simulation in real projects
