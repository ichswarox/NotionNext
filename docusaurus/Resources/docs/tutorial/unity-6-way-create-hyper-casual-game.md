#### Course Overview

This course will guide you step by step, from your first line of code to publishing a finished project. You won't just master Unity 6 tools; you'll create a fully-fledged game worthy of a portfolio.

- **New Features in Unity 6:** Explore the latest engine tools that will help speed up development and improve project quality.

Thanks to our practical approach, you'll be able to confidently create your own projects or apply for a position as a junior mobile developer.
