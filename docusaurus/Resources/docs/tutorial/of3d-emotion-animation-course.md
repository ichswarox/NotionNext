### Course Overview

This training is a step-by-step guide to creating realistic animations from scratch – we've tested and proven them to be a great differentiator for potentially profiting in the rendering field and enabling you to generate more value for your portfolio. You will be led sequentially and logically through lessons that teach a practical and highly scalable workflow, until you finally learn how and how much to charge for a realistic animation.

**Exponentially increase your business revenue with animations.** They are a gold mine, you just need to know how to make them flawlessly and how to sell them for the right price. Don't worry, we'll give you the stone path.

**It's not about pushing buttons.** Much more than learning every detail of the software, understand how to create cool animations by refining your look and exploring your creativity.

**Do not waste time.** What once took years to be learned within Archviz, now, with the right technology and method, you can do it in months (or even days!).

## Course Features

### What You'll Learn

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="fundamentals" label="Fundamentals" default>
#### FUNDAMENTALS

Animations are one of the most powerful visual aids when we want to present an idea, tell a story and, of course, sell a real estate development. The problem is that the most common defects in animations in the 3D architecture market are in details that often go unnoticed.

The animation doesn't look good, and the Artist doesn't even know why. That's why we emphasize so much the need for a good foundation: what is, in fact, an animation? What are keyframes, curves, transitions and other basic concepts that are so important in this market? Mastering these aspects will get you started on the right foot in one of the most lucrative fields in Archviz!
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="camera" label="Camera Movements">
#### CAMERA MOVEMENTS

Ever watched a movie that gripped your attention so much that you just couldn't take your eyes off the screen? In every take, in every transition, there are camera movements that are so natural and well-designed that we often don't even notice what's going on behind the scenes of that footage.

Within 3D it is no different. Just imagine creating an amazing scene, and losing animation quality because the camera went too fast? Or else try to orbit an object and lose the frame because the camera was not well positioned? Rest assured, we won't let you waste hours and hours of work by not knowing how to move the cameras the right way.

In this module, you will learn which are the most used camera movements and how to choose the ideal movement to use in your animations.

<TabItem value="advanced" label="Advanced Techniques">
#### GETTING OUT OF THE BASICS

Our eyes observe life in motion every day. This is why bringing scenes to life within Archviz is so important. Yeah, just basic camera movements and "tours" inside the environments is not enough. Think about what is happening around you at this very moment: cars passing by, curtains swaying, trees and their leaves blowing in the wind, water from a swimming pool or a faucet, a fire from a fireplace, smoke from a chimney, lights going on and off all the time.

Here you'll learn how to animate each of these fluids and objects so that your environments aren't static and lifeless, but dynamic and full of emotion!

## Student Success Stories

### Alexandre Cavalcanti
He was a manager in a large public bank, with a degree, two MBAs… but he wasn't satisfied. He decided to change profession and found out about OF3D Academy training. In just 3 months, he was able to close his first contract for 3,000 DOLLARS in rendering alone.

### Letícia Agostinho
She used to charge between $5.00 and $7.00 per render. And by adjusting her workflow and the way she charges for her work just a little, with the knowledge from the course, she was able to increase the value of her work by more than 10 times.

### Matheus Pinto
With 3 months of the course, he was able to invest in a $2.4 thousand PC. In 6 months, he learned more than in 5 years studying on his own.

### Daniel Albanaz
With OF3D Academy training, Daniel was able to fulfill his and his wife's biggest dream.
