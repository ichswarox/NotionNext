## Instructor

**Joshua Krassenstein** - Game Developer, Instructor, and Father

Hi, my name is Josh and I'm a game developer with over 6 years of experience in the industry. I have worked on a variety of game projects, including 2D platformers, puzzle games, and action-adventure games.

I am a father of two kids, and in my free time, I love to spend time with my family and play games with them. I also enjoy streaming my game development process on Twitch.

I am passionate about helping others learn and get into game development and design. I believe that anyone with the desire to create games can do so with the right guidance and resources. That's why I have decided to create courses on Udemy, to share my knowledge and experience with aspiring game developers.

I am always ready and willing to help anyone who has questions or needs support. If you're ready to start your journey in game development, join me in this course and let's create some amazing games together!
