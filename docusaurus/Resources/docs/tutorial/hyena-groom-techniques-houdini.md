In this course, you'll learn how to create realistic fur for creatures in VFX, developing a robust and efficient production workflow with Houdini, Solaris Karma, Mari and Zbrush.

We'll begin by studying the basics of grooming in Houdini, where we'll explore how to generate and control fur according to its different lengths and areas on the creature's body: short hair, long hair, and tail. Each section of the character requires a specific approach, and I'll show you step-by-step techniques that will allow you to achieve detailed and professional results.

We'll then work on integrating Solaris with Karma, configuring materials, shaders, and render parameters to ensure a photorealistic finish. You'll learn how to prepare your scene for lighting and rendering in an orderly manner, optimizing your production workflow.

We'll also explore the creation of textures in Mari, essential for adding realism and visual richness to your project. You'll see how to generate maps that add depth as a displacement maps and variation to the fur, achieving a believable, cinematic-quality final result.

By the end of the course, you'll have a complete and practical pipeline for creating fur creatures, applicable to both personal projects and film, series, and advertising productions and videogames and more.
