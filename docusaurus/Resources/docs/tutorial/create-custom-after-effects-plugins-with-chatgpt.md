## Description

Build your first After Effects plugin‚Äîeven if you can't code. In this course, you'll use ChatGPT to create a custom tool, install it as a dockable panel, and launch a plugin you can reuse or sell.

You'll learn how plugins fit into real video editing workflows, why they save time and money, and how to turn one idea into a practical textures plugin. Then you'll install it correctly on Mac and Windows, pin it in your workspace, and study a real YouTuber example to see what's possible. Finally, you'll build and ship your own plugin in a guided capstone.

No fluff, no jargon‚Äîjust the exact prompts, files, and steps you need.

By the end, you'll have a working After Effects plugin, installed as a panel, plus the skills to build more for motion graphics and 3D animation projects, and even offer them to clients or online.
