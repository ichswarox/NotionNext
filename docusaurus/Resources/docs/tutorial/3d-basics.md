# 3D Modeling Basics

Learn the fundamental concepts of 3D modeling in this beginner-friendly guide.

## What is 3D Modeling?

3D modeling is the process of creating a digital representation of a three-dimensional object using specialized software. These models can be used for various purposes including:

- Animation and visual effects
- Video game development
- Architectural visualization
- Product design
- 3D printing

## Core Concepts

### Vertices, Edges, and Faces

- **Vertices**: Points in 3D space (the corners of objects)
- **Edges**: Lines connecting vertices
- **Faces**: Surfaces enclosed by edges (triangles, quads, etc.)

### Mesh Topology

Good topology is crucial for:
- Smooth deformation during animation
- Clean rendering and shading
- Efficient editing workflows

### UV Mapping

UV mapping is the process of projecting a 2D image onto a 3D model's surface. It's essential for:
- Applying textures
- Adding surface details
- Creating realistic materials

## Basic Techniques

### Polygon Modeling

Start with primitive shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder) and:
1. Add geometry with extrude, inset, and loop cut tools
2. Adjust vertex positions for desired shape
3. Maintain clean quad-based topology

### Sculpting

Digital sculpting is like working with clay:
1. Use dynamic tessellation for detail
2. Apply sculpting brushes for organic shapes
3. Use masking to protect areas during editing

## Getting Started

1. Practice with simple objects like a coffee mug or apple
2. Study real-world references
3. Learn keyboard shortcuts for your software
4. Understand the software interface

## Best Practices

- Save your work frequently
- Use meaningful file names
- Organize your scene with naming conventions
- Keep backup versions of important work
