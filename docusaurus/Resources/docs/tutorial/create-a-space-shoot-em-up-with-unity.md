Hi, I'm James. I have helped thousands of people learn how to develop their own games in Unity, and whether you're a first-time developer, or need to refresh your skills, I can help you learn to make the games you want to make.

With a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a background working in independent game development, I have been helping others to create their own games and release them on multiple platforms.

I believe in helping you learn by teaching code in context, so rather than having to memorize a bunch of stuff you've never seen before, you learn how each coding concept can be applied to real working problems in your games.

**I can't wait to help you learn all about making your own games and how to make them a success.**

So why not start learning to make games with me now?

See you soon!

James

## Student Reviews

**Maxx C.** - Rating: 5.0
> Great course, was very easy to follow and went over everything thoroughly.

**Olaf S.** - Rating: 4.0
> Auch wenn der Kurs schon einige Jahre alt ist, kann er erfolgreich mit der neuesten Unity-Version umgesetzt werden. Das im Kurs erstellte Spiel ist umfangreich, zeigt viele interessante Techniken und animiert zur eigenen Weiterentwicklung. Meines Erachtens sollte man aber erste Unity-Grundkenntnisse mitbringen. Leider beantwortet der Ersteller des Kurses bereits seit einigen Jahren keine Fragen mehr. Deshalb habe ich nur vier Sterne fÃ¼r den Kurs gegeben, der an sich fÃ¼nf Sterne wert ist.
