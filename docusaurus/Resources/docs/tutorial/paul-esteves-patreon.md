## Overview

HELLO! Welcome to my Patreon page. Thank you so much for taking the time to check it out. I hope to answer all your questions below, if not, contact me via social media and I'd love to answer any further questions! 

WHO AM I? I'm Paul Esteves. I'm currently based in Munich, Germany. However, I'm originally from a sunny little town in South Africa called Durban. I'm a freelance 3D artist/motion designer who hangs out in Houdini and Redshift. You can see the type of work I create on my social media links below.

## How It Works

You choose your desired tier. Each tier gives you access to different rewards. After your pledge you will have to pay up front. So, it makes sense to pledge at the beginning of a month. Once you've chosen your tier and paid, you get access to everything in that tier level immediately. You can cancel at any time and you will still have access till the end of that billing cycle (usually the end of the month).

## Content Coverage

I will be focused mainly on Houdini and Redshift. Focusing on workflows, vellum, SOP level tools and general design/rendering techniques I use. I will also be releasing project files monthly to go along with my tutorials.
