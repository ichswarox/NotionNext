## Course Description

**Struggled to finish a game? This is the antidote. No experience needed!**

No overwhelming theory! Just Practical, Effective and Simple game development! From an empty project to a complete, polished car parking game you can share with your friends. No prior coding or Unity knowledge is required. I break down every single step into simple, bite-sized pieces.

**This isn't a lecture; it's a hands-on build. Let's create something awesome, together!**

### What You'll BUILD:

In this project-based course, you will create a functional and addictive car parking game from the ground up. You will:

- **Drive & Control a Car:** Import a car asset and bring it to life! Add Physics with Wheel Colliders and Rigidbodies, then write simple, powerful code for acceleration, steering, and a handbrake.

- **Design a Parking Lot from Scratch:** Build your entire parking scene using simple models. Turn your creations into prefabs and set up the physics for a fun challenge.

- **Create the Core Gameplay:** Script a system that spawns a new car only after you've successfully parked the last one. Manage a 10-car fleet and track your best time!

- **Code the Smart & Simple Way:** Use the **Observer Pattern** to keep your code organized and easy to understand. No spaghetti code here! just clean, logical, and manageable scripts.

- **Make It Look PRO:** Make your game look GOOD! From basic to beautiful using Unity's Post Processing stack and Adaptive Probe Volumes for stunning lighting (no artistic skills needed).

- **Build & Share Your Game:** Finally, compile your finished game into an executable file you can send to anyone and play on PC.

### Why This Course?

- **Stupid Simple:** I explain every concept from the absolute beginning. If you can open Unity, you can do this.

- **No Fluff, All Fun:** We cut the boring theory and focus on immediate, gratifying results. See progress in every single lesson.

- **Super Simple Code:** I teach you the most direct and effective ways to code. You'll write minimal, powerful lines that are easy to understand and adapt.

- **For the Frustrated & The Quitters:** If other tutorials made you feel lost, this is your reset button. We focus on fun and momentum to keep you motivated from start to finish.

**By the end of this course, you won't just have followed a tutorial but you'll have built a complete game!**
