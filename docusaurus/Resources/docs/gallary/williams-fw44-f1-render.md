:::tip Automotive Visualization
Creating realistic automotive renders requires deep knowledge of the vehicle's engineering and materials. Every detail, from the tire tread to the aerodynamic components, contributes to the overall authenticity.
:::

## Technical Process

High-quality automotive visualization typically involves:

1. **Reference Gathering**: Collecting detailed photos and technical drawings
2. **Modeling**: Creating accurate 3D geometry with proper topology
3. **Shader Development**: Crafting realistic materials for carbon fiber, paint, chrome, and rubber
4. **Lighting Setup**: Using studio lighting or environment-based illumination
5. **Rendering**: Leveraging powerful GPU renderers like Redshift

:::info
Formula 1 cars have incredibly complex surfaces with numerous small details. Achieving photorealism requires attention to even the smallest components like bolts, vents, and aerodynamic elements.
