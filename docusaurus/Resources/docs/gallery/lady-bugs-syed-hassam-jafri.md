## Design Elements

### Biological Accuracy
- Anatomically correct ladybug structure
- Accurate coloration patterns and markings
- Proper scale and proportion representation
- Detailed surface texture and micro-details
- Realistic leg and antenna positioning

### Visual Features
1. **Coloration**: Vibrant reds with black spots and white markings
2. **Surface Detail**: Shell texture, leg segmentation, and body hairs
3. **Lighting Response**: Natural light interaction with organic surfaces
4. **Environmental Context**: Optional natural habitat elements
5. **Behavioral Elements**: Natural poses and positioning

:::info Scientific Illustration
3D visualization of biological subjects serves both educational and artistic purposes, requiring research and attention to detail to accurately represent the subject.
