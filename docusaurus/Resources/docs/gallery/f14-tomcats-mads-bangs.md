# F-14 Tomcats by Mads Bangs

This detailed aircraft render demonstrates the complexity of creating realistic military hardware with accurate materials and intricate cockpit details.

## Project Highlights

- **Complex Geometry**: Thousands of precisely modeled parts
- **Metal Materials**: Accurate metal shaders with proper reflections
- **Cockpit Detail**: High-detail interior with controls and instrumentation
- **Scale Reference**: Proper proportions and real-world measurements

:::tip Aircraft Modeling
Military aircraft have distinctive materials and complex geometries that require specialized techniques to render convincingly.
:::

## Technical Approach

Creating detailed aircraft renders involves:

1. **Reference Gathering**: Collecting photos and technical drawings
2. **Model Breakdown**: Separating into manageable components
3. **Material Research**: Understanding real material properties
4. **Lighting Setup**: Industrial environment with appropriate lighting

:::info
F-14 Tomcats feature both metallic and non-metallic surfaces, each requiring different shader approaches for realistic rendering.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="fuselage" label="Fuselage" default>
    - **Primary Material**: Aluminum alloy with wear patterns
    - **Detail Work**: Panel lines and surface textures
    - **Decals**: Precision placement of markings
    - **Normals**: Proper smoothing for aerodynamic shapes
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cockpit" label="Cockpit">
    - **Complex Geometry**: Hundreds of small controls and instruments
    - **Material Variety**: Metal, plastic, glass, and fabric elements
    - **Lighting**: Interior illumination with instrument glow
    - **Detailing**: Weathering and wear for realism
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="engine" label="Engine">
    - **Heat Effects**: Thermal distortion and exhaust effects
    - **Complex Components**: Turbine blades and internal structures
    - **Material Properties**: High-temperature metals and ceramics
    - **Reflections**: Accurate metallic and worn surfaces
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution
Aircraft modeling requires extensive reference material. Always verify proportions and details against real-world examples.

## Tools and Workflow

Professional aircraft artists typically employ:

- **Modeling**: Fusion 360 or SolidWorks for precision
- **Detail Work**: Cinema 4D or Maya for organic elements
- **Rendering**: Redshift 3D for high-quality output
- **Texturing**: Substance Painter for detailed surface work

:::note
Military aircraft often have classified elements, so artists use declassified or publicly available reference material for accuracy.
