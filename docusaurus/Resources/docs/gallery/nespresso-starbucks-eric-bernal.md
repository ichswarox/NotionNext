## Visualization Approach

Professional product rendering workflow:

1. **Brand Research**: Understanding both Nespresso and Starbucks visual identities
2. **Reference Gathering**: Collecting product photos and technical specifications
3. **3D Modeling**: Creating precise geometry with attention to details
4. **Material Development**: Developing accurate shaders for metals, plastics, and branding elements
5. **Lighting Setup**: Studio lighting with precise control over reflections
6. **Camera Composition**: Multiple angles to showcase design features
7. **Rendering**: High-quality output with proper resolution for marketing

:::info Brand Consistency
Maintaining consistency with both brand guidelines requires careful attention to colors, materials, and overall aesthetic to satisfy both brand requirements.
