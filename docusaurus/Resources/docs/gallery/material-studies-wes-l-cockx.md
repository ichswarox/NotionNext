## Development Process

Professional material study workflow:

- **Research Phase**: Studying real-world material properties and behavior
- **Reference Collection**: Gathering physical samples and measurement data
- **Property Analysis**: Understanding how materials interact with light
- **Shader Creation**: Building node networks in Redshift
- **Texture Development**: Creating or sourcing appropriate textures
- **Lighting Setup**: Configuring illumination to showcase material properties
- **Testing and Refinement**: Iterative improvement based on results
- **Documentation**: Recording parameters for future use

:::caution Physical Accuracy
While artistic interpretation is important, maintaining physical accuracy in material properties ensures shaders will behave correctly under various lighting conditions and in compositing workflows.
