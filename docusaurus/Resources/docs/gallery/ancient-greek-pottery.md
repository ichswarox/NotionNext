# Ancient Greek Pottery 3D Recreation

This project showcases a meticulous 3D recreation of ancient Greek pottery, demonstrating how modern 3D techniques can bring historical artifacts to life.

## Project Overview

- **Historical Reference**: Black-figure and red-figure pottery techniques
- **Modeling Approach**: High-detail polygon modeling
- **Texturing Method**: Procedural and hand-painted textures
- **Lighting Style**: Museum-quality illumination

:::tip Historical Accuracy
Achieving authenticity in historical recreations requires extensive research into both the cultural context and physical properties of the original artifacts.
:::

## Modeling Process

Creating accurate pottery involves understanding the original manufacturing techniques:

1. **Reference Gathering**: Collecting photographs and drawings of authentic pieces
2. **Form Creation**: Building the basic vessel shape with proper proportions
3. **Surface Detail**: Adding the characteristic slip and paint patterns
4. **Wear Simulation**: Creating realistic aging and weathering effects

:::info
Ancient Greek pottery was created using specific clay bodies and firing techniques that produced distinct color variations we need to replicate in 3D.
:::

## Texturing Techniques

Different approaches for various elements:

### Base Material
```
clay_base
├── Base color: Terracotta orange
├── Roughness: Medium-high for clay texture
└── Bump: Subtle surface irregularities
```

### Decorative Elements
```
slip_layer
├── Black slip: Near-black with slight brown tint
├── Red areas: Exposed clay showing through
└── Highlights: Subtle specular on wet-looking slip
```

:::caution Texture Resolution
Historical recreations often require high-resolution textures to capture the fine details visible in museum pieces.
:::

## Lighting Setup

Museum-style lighting with careful attention to:

- **Diffuse Fill**: Even illumination without harsh shadows
- **Specular Control**: Highlighting the glossy slip surfaces
- **Color Accuracy**: Neutral lighting to showcase true colors
- **Shadow Softness**: Large light sources for natural-looking shadows

:::note
The lighting should reveal surface details without creating distracting highlights that might obscure the artwork.

## Rendering Settings

Optimized Redshift settings for artifact visualization:

- **Samples**: High quality with adaptive sampling
- **Ray Depth**: Balanced for multiple reflections
- **Texture Resolution**: 4K+ for detailed surface work
- **Output Format**: Linear workflow for post-processing

### Comparison of Render Engines

Different engines offer various advantages:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
