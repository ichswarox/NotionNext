## Creative Visualization Process

Stylized interior rendering workflow:

- **Concept Development**: Defining the artistic style and mood
- **Color Planning**: Selecting vibrant palettes that support the theme
- **3D Modeling**: Creating geometry with emphasis on design elements
- **Material Development**: Developing shaders that enhance the stylized look
- **Lighting Setup**: Warm, inviting lighting with creative accent sources
- **Camera Composition**: Angles that showcase both design and atmosphere
- **Rendering**: High-quality output with attention to color and mood
