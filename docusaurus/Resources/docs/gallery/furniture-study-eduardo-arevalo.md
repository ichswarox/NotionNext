# Furniture Study by Eduardo Arevalo

This detailed furniture design study by Eduardo Arevalo showcases advanced 3D modeling techniques and realistic material representation for interior design visualization.

## Project Overview

- **Design Focus**: Furniture modeling and visualization
- **Technical Approach**: Precision modeling with attention to detail
- **Material Accuracy**: Realistic representation of wood, fabric, and metal
- **Design Application**: Interior visualization and product presentation

:::tip Furniture Visualization
Furniture visualization requires a deep understanding of joinery, materials, and manufacturing processes to create believable and accurate representations.
:::

## Modeling Process

Creating detailed furniture models involves:

1. **Reference Collection**: Gathering design references and technical drawings
2. **Proportional Modeling**: Establishing accurate overall dimensions
3. **Detail Work**: Creating joinery, hardware, and surface details
4. **Material Assignment**: Applying appropriate shaders to different components
5. **Lighting Setup**: Studio lighting to showcase form and materials
6. **Rendering**: High-quality output for presentation

:::info Scale and Proportion
Furniture design is heavily dependent on accurate scale and proportion. Always verify measurements against real-world references to ensure believability.
:::

## Technical Challenges

Furniture visualization presents unique challenges:

- **Joinery Details**: Accurately representing how pieces connect
- **Material Transitions**: Handling transitions between different materials
- **Surface Finishes**: Representing various wood grains, fabrics, and metals
- **Reflection Control**: Managing reflections on glossy surfaces
- **Detail Resolution**: Balancing detail with efficient geometry

:::caution Measurement Accuracy
Inaccurate proportions can make furniture look toy-like or unrealistic. Always verify critical dimensions against real-world references.

## Tools and Techniques

For furniture visualization:

- **3D Software**: Cinema 4D, 3ds Max, or Blender
- **Reference Materials**: Technical drawings and product photos
- **Material Libraries**: Wood, fabric, and metal shader collections
- **Lighting Setup**: Studio environments with controlled lighting
- **Rendering Engine**: Redshift for photorealistic output
- **Post-Processing**: Photoshop for final enhancement

:::tip Component-Based Modeling
Model furniture as separate components that can be reused in different scenes. This approach saves time and maintains consistency across projects.
