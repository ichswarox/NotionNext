Casey_Sheep, a developer known for creating numerous useful addons, has released "Drop Cast," a new physics-based scattering tool for Blender. This addon simplifies the process of populating scenes with assets, using physics for realistic placement.


> With Drop Cast, you can transform any asset collection into a complete scene in seconds. No more tedious manual placementâ€”just drop, scatter, and you're done.

### Key Features

*   **Real-time Physics Drop Mode**: Easily operate with simple hotkeys: `Tab` to generate, `G` to drag, and `Enter` to finish.
*   **Clean Control**: Manage generation weights, hide assets individually, and use custom icons for better organization.
*   **Natural Variation**: Achieve organic looks with random size and rotation on a per-axis basis.
*   **Simple Passive Colliders**: Set up colliders with options for Convex Hull, Mesh, Box, or Sphere.
*   **Lightweight Instances**: All placed objects are linked instances, keeping file sizes small and performance high.
*   **Effortless Asset Placement**: Scatter objects throughout your scene with just a few clicks.
*   **Fully Customizable**: Set individual spawn probabilities for each asset, randomize sizes, and adjust the dimensions of the drop area.


While there are many scattering addons available, Drop Cast stands out for its convenience and ease of use.
