### Key Features

-   **Over 150 Animal Species**: A diverse library of insects, terrestrial animals, birds, and fish covers almost any scene or environment.
-   **Real-time Movement Simulation**: Animals react instantly to terrain, obstacles, and simulation rules.
-   **Enhance Realism in a Few Clicks**: Quickly incorporate lifelike animals and natural movements into your scenes.
-   **Self-Collision Avoidance**: Individuals maintain distance from each other, preventing crowding and visual artifacts.
-   **Goal-Oriented**: Assign targets and guide animals with precise control over direction, speed, intensity, and reactivity.
-   **Avoidance**: Agents can intelligently avoid static obstacles and other agents.
-   **Fear**: Supports dynamic simulation rules that trigger sudden escape responses when threats approach.
-   **Attraction**: Guide creatures to objects or locations such as food, light sources, or characters.
-   **Curve Following**: Animate groups along a BÃ©zier curve.
-   **Collision**: Agents detect and avoid terrain, walls, and custom meshes with real-time geometric recognition logic.
-   **Fast Switching**: Seamlessly switch between crawling, flying, and hybrid modes at any time.
-   **Proxy Preview Mode**: Enable lightweight point cloud data or proxy displays for smooth animation of large crowds.
-   **Generate Idle Animals/Birds**: Instantly fill backgrounds with creatures exhibiting natural, low-activity behaviors.
-   **Draw Flying Bird Flocks**: Sketch natural flight paths for birds using curves directly in the viewport.
