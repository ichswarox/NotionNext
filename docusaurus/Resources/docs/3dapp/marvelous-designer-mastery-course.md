## Overview

Marvelous Designer is one of the most powerful tools for fashion design, 3D modeling, and visualization, and in this course we'll go deep into its workflows. You'll learn how to set up avatars, design patterns, stitch garments, and simulate realistic fabrics for both fashion and architecture.
