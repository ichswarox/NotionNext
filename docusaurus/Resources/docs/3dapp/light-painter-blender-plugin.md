## Key Features of Light Painter V1.5.5

This plugin revolutionizes how you approach lighting in Blender with its intuitive painting interface:

- **Selective Surface Lighting**: You do not need to paint the entire surface. Draw a few simple strokes over surfaces that you'd like highlighted by your light.
- **Tube Light Creation**: For tube lights, use the right click button to end the current stroke and start a new one ‚Äì this creates separate tube lights.
- **Flexible Drawing Tools**: Single clicks draw straight lines (useful for geometric shapes), while holding down the mouse button draws freeform strokes.
- **Multi-Surface Support**: Draw on multiple surfaces. The tools can handle most cases where surfaces face different directions.
- **Spot Lamp Optimization**: Spot lamps prefer circular strokes. If you're not confident in drawing circles, a painted line representing the diameter is sufficient.
- **Area Lamp Versatility**: Area lamps work with rectangles, squares, circles, or a single painted line. You can change the area lamp's shape in the redo panel.
- **Point Lamp Simplicity**: Point lamps are the most forgiving since their rotation is irrelevant.

### Time-Saving Solution

This plugin dramatically reduces the time spent on lighting setup, allowing you to focus more on creative decisions rather than technical implementation. The visual feedback you get while painting makes it easy to achieve the exact lighting effects you envision.
