This tool is particularly useful for artists and developers working on low-poly assets who need precise pixel-level control.

:::note Developer's Insight
"Pixel Dot Drawer is a simple addon for drawing pixel art in Blender's texture editor. I created this small tool because Blender doesn't draw an accurate 1x1 pixel in the texture editor."

This addon could be a great help when creating low-poly assets.
