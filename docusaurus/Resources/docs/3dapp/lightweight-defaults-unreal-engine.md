Leon Gameworks has developed and released "Lightweight Defaults," a free Unreal Engine 5 plugin that makes the editor lighter and more comfortable for development on low-spec machines.

## Lightweight Defaults

**Lightweight Defaults** is a plugin that reduces the rendering load of the editor with a single click. It is designed to improve performance when launching the editor and to keep development smooth even on low-spec machines.

-   **No setup required:** Simply enable the plugin to reduce the load, and all settings can be adjusted directly from the menu bar.
-   **Preset switching:** Instantly apply quality presets: Low/Medium/High/Epic/Cinematic.
-   **Scalability control:** Individually adjust scalability settings such as anti-aliasing, post-processing, shadows, global illumination, and textures.
-   **Rendering control:** Freely switch motion blur, bloom, ambient occlusion, volume cloud, custom depth, etc.
-   **Real-time viewport control:** Quickly turn on/off real-time rendering of the viewport.

:::caution Important Notes

Please note that the weight reduction in this plugin is for the purpose of comfortable operation of the editor, so while the editor will be lighter, the game itself is not essentially optimized.
Also, projects that assume Lumen or Virtual Texture will not work correctly with low quality settings (as they are projects that assume high-spec PCs).

:::

This plugin seems to be useful when working on a laptop.
It also seems very convenient for things like turning off motion blur during work.
"Lightweight Defaults" is available for free from Fab!
