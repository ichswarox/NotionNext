## Key Features

:::tip[Key Features]
- **No Configuration Required**: Simply drag V-Ray scenes into Chaos Vantage to start browsing. Unlike previous real-time rendering solutions, no geometry optimization, UV mapping, or light baking is required.
- **Large Scenes**: Chaos Vantage can handle huge scenes with millions of polygons. It's the fastest way to see complex V-Ray scenes in real-time.
- **Easy Navigation**: Easily browse your scenes. Similar to 3D modeling software control modes or game-like navigation. Automatic collision detection allows you to walk up stairs or avoid walking through walls.
- **100% Ray Tracing Quality**: Full real-time ray tracing rendering. Chaos Vantage uses physically-based cameras, lights, materials, and global illumination for the most realistic results.
- **Quick and Simple Animation Creation**: Perfect for pre-rendering. You can directly create, edit, and render animations in Chaos Vantage. Use the animation editor to easily create camera animations, transitions, and adjust sequence order.
- **Live Link**: Get real-time ray tracing views of your scenes and render animations through Live Links with 3ds Max, SketchUp, and Rhino. Edits made to your scene will appear directly in Chaos Vantage.
