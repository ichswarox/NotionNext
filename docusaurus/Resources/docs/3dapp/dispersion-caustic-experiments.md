## Optical Phenomena Explained

Understanding the science behind these effects:

### Dispersion Effects

Dispersion occurs when light separates into its component colors as it passes through a refractive medium:

- **Prism Effect**: White light splitting into rainbow colors
- **Chromatic Aberration**: Color fringing in camera lenses
- **Gemstone Rendering**: Realistic diamond and crystal appearance
- **Water Droplets**: Rainbow formation after rainfall

### Caustic Effects

Caustics are the concentrated light patterns created when light reflects or refracts off curved surfaces:

:::info Light Concentration
Caustics represent some of the most computationally intensive lighting effects in 3D rendering due to their complex light path calculations.
