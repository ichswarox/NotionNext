> With Drop Cast, you can transform any asset collection into a complete scene in seconds. No more tedious manual placement—just drop, scatter, and you're done.

### Key Features

*   **Real-time Physics Drop Mode**: Easily operate with simple hotkeys: `Tab` to generate, `G` to drag, and `Enter` to finish.
*   **Clean Control**: Manage generation weights, hide assets individually, and use custom icons for better organization.
*   **Natural Variation**: Achieve organic looks with random size and rotation on a per-axis basis.
*   **Simple Passive Colliders**: Set up colliders with options for Convex Hull, Mesh, Box, or Sphere.
*   **Lightweight Instances**: All placed objects are linked instances, keeping file sizes small and performance high.
*   **Effortless Asset Placement**: Scatter objects throughout your scene with just a few clicks.
*   **Fully Customizable**: Set individual spawn probabilities for each asset, randomize sizes, and adjust the dimensions of the drop area.
