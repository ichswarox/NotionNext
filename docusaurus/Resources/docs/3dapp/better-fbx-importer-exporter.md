## Why Choose Better FBX Importer & Exporter?

When working with 3D assets in Blender, FBX compatibility is crucial for seamless collaboration between different software platforms. The native FBX support in Blender has limitations that can cause import failures or data loss. Better FBX Importer & Exporter addresses these issues with a robust solution that ensures reliable transfer of 3D assets.

### Professional-Grade Compatibility

Unlike Blender's built-in FBX tools, this plugin maintains full compatibility with FBX files from various sources and software packages. Whether you're working with assets from Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, or other 3D applications, this addon ensures smooth data transfer without compatibility issues.

### Comprehensive Data Preservation

The plugin carefully preserves all essential 3D data during import and export operations, including:
- Geometry and mesh data
- Materials and textures
- Animation sequences
- Scene hierarchy and object relationships
- Camera and light settings

## System Requirements

- **Supported Software**: Blender 2.8+
- **Supported FBX Versions**: 5.3 through 2020
- **File Format Support**: ASCII and Binary FBX
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Installation Problems
Some users have reported installation errors. If you encounter issues:
1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Open the extracted folder
3. Repackage the contents into a new ZIP file
4. Install the newly created ZIP file

This issue occurs because some download sources add an extra folder layer, while Blender requires a single folder structure for addons.

### Texture and Material Issues
If exported FBX files lack textures:
1. Select File → External Data → Pack All Into .blend
2. Open the file again and choose to Unpack All
3. Alternatively, set all paths to relative
4. Then export
