## Boost Your Efficiency in After Effects

**Auto Crop** is an essential tool for any motion graphics artist or video editor working in Adobe After Effects. This powerful script allows you to instantly crop your composition to the perfect size based on its contents, saving you valuable time and eliminating tedious manual adjustments.

Auto Crop intelligently analyzes your composition and offers three precise cropping methods:

1.  **Auto Crop:** Automatically crops your composition based on the bounding box of its visible layers, ignoring transparent pixels.
2.  **Auto Crop Duration:** Crops the composition based on its entire duration.
3.  **Crop to Mask:** Allows you to define a specific crop area using a mask.

This tool works quickly and accurately, regardless of the complexity or type of layers within your composition.
