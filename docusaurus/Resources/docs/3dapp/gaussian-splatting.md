## Bring 3D Gaussian Splatting into Your AE Workflow

Unlock the power of 3D content within your 2D workflow with the **Gaussian Splatting plugin for After Effects**. This tool allows you to import, manipulate, and render 3D Gaussian Splatting (`.ply`) files directly inside After Effects, with real-time, GPU-accelerated performance.

This opens up new creative possibilities, allowing you to integrate detailed 3D reconstructed models and scenes into your motion graphics and visual effects projects seamlessly.

### Key Features

- **Direct `.ply` Import:** Natively import 3D models created using Gaussian Splatting techniques.
- **Real-Time GPU Rendering:** Manipulate and preview your 3D models in real-time within the After Effects viewport, accelerated by your GPU.
