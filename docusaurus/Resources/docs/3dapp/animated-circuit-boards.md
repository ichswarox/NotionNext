:::tip[info]
**circuitFX** is a specialized tool for After Effects designed to generate intricate, graphical circuit board animations. With a single button press, the script creates a new, randomized circuit pattern every time.

Beyond just the circuit lines and circles, circuitFX also generates components like chips, resistors, and capacitors. It gives you the flexibility to create all parts on a single shape layer or to generate separate shape layers for each component, allowing for detailed customization. This tool is ideal for technology or sci-fi related projects, animated backgrounds, HUDs, and more.
