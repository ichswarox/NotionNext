**R3DS Faceform Wrap 2025.9.19 for Windows** is a cutting-edge 3D topology software that revolutionizes the way you process 3D scan data. When working with a large set of similar objects, such as human scans, Wrap allows you to take an existing basemesh and non-rigidly fit it to each scan, saving you significant time and effort.

### Features

-   **Efficient Topology Transfer**: Easily wrap existing geometry around 3D scans or high-poly models.
-   **Non-Rigid Fitting**: Intelligently adapts a standard basemesh to fit various scans with high accuracy.
-   **Streamlined Workflow**: Simplifies the otherwise tedious process of retopologizing 3D scanned assets.

### Installation

1.  Install `Faceform_Wrap_2025.9.19_Setup.msi`.
2.  Launch Wrap once and then close it.
3.  Copy `trial.ini` to `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Faceform\Wrap\trial.ini`.
