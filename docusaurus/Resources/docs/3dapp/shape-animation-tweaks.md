## A New Way to Animate Shape Layers and Paths

**Tweaks** is a powerful script for After Effects that opens up new possibilities for shape and path animation. From morphing shapes to fine-tuning paths and innovatively distributing layers, this tool will enrich your creative experience.

With Tweaks, you can create complex and interactive animations, such as morphing between two shapes, creating reactions based on control points, and generating a wide variety of motion graphics animations. Your artistic possibilities expand, limited only by your creativity.
