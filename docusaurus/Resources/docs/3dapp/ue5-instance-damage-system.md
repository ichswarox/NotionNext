### Key Features

*   **Register Any Static Mesh Component as a Proxy**: Primarily for Instanced Static Mesh Components (ISMC), but can be extended to other object classes via C++.
*   **Per-Asset Damage Settings**: Define specific damage behaviors for each Static Mesh used as a proxy.
    *   **Spawn Destruction Meshes**: Replace damaged instances with destructible mesh versions.
*   **Toggle Instance Visibility**: Hide and show proxy instances as needed.
*   **Distance-Based Respawning**: Automatically respawn instances over time based on their distance from the player.
*   **Object Pooling**: Reuse generated destruction meshes to improve performance.
*   **World Partition Support**: Toggle instance visibility even when the proxy is not present in the level.
*   **Custom Data**: Assign custom data like "XP" or "money" to each damage asset.
*   **Network Support (3 Modes)**:
    *   **Client Authoritative**: Client spawns the destruction mesh, and the server notifies other clients.
    *   **Client Replicated**: Destruction meshes are spawned on the client via replication.
    *   **Server**: The server manages and replicates the destruction actor.
*   **Save/Load Proxy Visibility State**.
*   **Easy Setup from Data Tables**.
*   **Blueprint Ready**: Easily scriptable throughout your project.
*   **C++ Extensible**: Add new features or override default behaviors using subsystems and virtual functions.
*   **Includes Sample Projects**:
    *   **Chaos Minigame**: *Saints Row* "Mayhem"-style gameplay.
    *   **Destruction Minigame**: Destroy randomly selected meshes.
    *   **Wanted Level Example**: Increase a "wanted" level based on the amount of destruction.
