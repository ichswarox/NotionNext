**SDFusion**, a new toolkit addon by developer Hinata Fugu, brings an intuitive, SDF (Signed Distance Field)-like workflow for non-destructive boolean and remeshing operations to Blender.

### Key Features

*   **Intuitive Layer Operations**: Simply place objects into "ADD" or "SUB" collections. No complex modifier setup is required.
*   **Non-Destructive Workflow**: Adjust the position and shape of cutter objects at any time, allowing for iterative design and experimentation.
*   **Real-time Control**: Instantly adjust the resolution and smoothness of the entire model with sliders and preview the results in real-time.
*   **One-Click Finalize & Organize**: Apply all calculations and generate a clean mesh with a single button. Used cutters are automatically stored in a separate collection, keeping your scene tidy.

:::note[Who is this for?]
SDFusion is highly recommended for:
*   Artists who find boolean operations difficult and want a simpler method.
*   Hard-surface modelers looking to streamline their workflow.
*   Concept designers who need to bring ideas to life quickly.
*   Anyone who wants to reduce their overall modeling time.
:::

#### Included Cutter Asset Pack
The addon comes bundled with a high-quality collection of original cutter assets perfect for hard-surface modeling and concept design. This eliminates the need to create basic cutting shapes from scratch, dramatically speeding up the modeling process.

### Package Contents
*   SDFusion Addon (`__init__.py`)
*   Original Cutter Asset Collection (`.blend` file)

:::caution Important Note
The addon provides an **SDF-like** experience. It does not use Geometry Nodes but is structurally a boolean workflow based on collections.

#### Acknowledgements
The development of SDFusion was greatly influenced by pioneering addons like **Boolean Quick Remesh (BQR)** and **Simply Concept**. SDFusion honors the concept of an intuitive boolean workflow they introduced while exploring a new approach that utilizes Blender's native collection system for a simpler, more organized user experience.
