## Overview

Carbon is the next generation physics library in development at Numerion Software. The goal is to provide a unified physics framework supporting the simulation of Soft and Rigid bodies with collision and motion constraints (such as Joints), in an easy to use, high performance package for movie developers, video games and other markets such as virtual fashion and augmented reality. Carbon uses non-linear constraint solvers to deliver a robustness not typically seen in real-time solutions.

## Features

- **Next Generation Physics**: Advanced physics engine for cloth simulation
- **Soft and Rigid Body Simulation**: Comprehensive simulation capabilities
- **Collision Detection**: Advanced collision and motion constraints
- **High Performance**: Optimized for real-time applications
- **Non-linear Constraint Solvers**: Robust simulation algorithms

## System Requirements

- Maya 2023-2026
- Windows operating system
- Compatible graphics card
- Sufficient RAM for simulation work
