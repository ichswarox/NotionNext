You I need to analyze the provided Markdown file and optimize it according to Docusaurus best practices, following the template provided. Let me break down the requirements:


0. Optimize the Markdown for Docusaurus using features like Admonitions, Tabs, Create appropriate frontmatter etc.
(frontmatter with:
    ---
    title: ""
    description: "this is a description"
    tags: [tags]
    slug: /name
    ---)
and Post structure:
   - top left is update time, format is: Last updated: Sep date 2025
   - Use a main banner image:
    first banner image is like: 
    ![Alt-Name](https://www.gfxcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.jpg),
    and use Direct use picture link from original markdown file.

   - Feature list using Docusaurus lists or Admonitions
   - Installation instructions with Tabs for different scenarios in a clear cable
   - Download links in a table format and should in last part of content
1. Translate the content to English
