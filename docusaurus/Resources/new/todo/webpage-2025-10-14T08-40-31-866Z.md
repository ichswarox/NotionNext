## From zero to advanced  
**THE STEP BY STEP TO CREATE AMAZING ARCHVIZ ANIMATIONS!**

## AN ANIMATION IS WORTH MORE  
**THAN A THOUSAND IMAGES**

![](https://of3dacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Layer-45-copy-3-copiar.png)

This training is a step-by-step guide to creating realistic animations from scratch – we’ve tested and proven them to be a great differentiator for potentially profiting in the rendering field and enabling you to generate more value for your portfolio. You will be led sequentially and logically through lessons that teach a practical and highly scalable workflow, until you finally learn how and how much to charge for a realistic animation.

**Exponentially increase your business revenue with animations.** They are a gold mine, you just need to know how to make them flawlessly and how to sell them for the right price. Don’t worry, we’ll give you the stone path.

**It’s not about pushing buttons.** Much more than learning every detail of the software, understand how to create cool animations by refining your look and exploring your creativity.

**Do not waste time.** What once took years to be learned within Archviz, now, with the right technology and method, you can do it in months (or even days!).

**How much does it cost not to have all of this?** If you were mastering animation today, and with that, you were earning 5, 10, 20, 50 thousand reais per month and you were available to work wherever you want with what you really love, what would you be doing?

**Get where you never got before.** Become the most sought-after and well-paid professional in the architecture field.

**A niche that has growing demand, is simple and has less hassle.** The rendering market in Brazil and in the world is only growing. And the best: the competition for those who stand out is very low.

## KNOW YOUR  
TEACHER

![](https://of3dacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Layer-45-copy-3-copiar.png)

## Born in Blumenau (SC), Ander entered the architecture market in 1996, at just 15 years old, after taking his first architectural design course.  
  
Ander left architecture school to study animation, and after participating in the production of the international feature film “Asterix and the Vikings”, he decided to unite his two greatest passions.  
  
In 2004 he opened his own architectural rendering studio, Oficina3D Studio, serving clients in Brazil and around the world. Years later, in 2019, feeling the need to share his experience, Ander started creating weekly tutorials and videos about the rendering industry.  
  
In the same year, he founded the OF3D Academy, where he teaches and mentors professional courses in the area. Today it has a large team that together have impacted tens of thousands of people.

## **WHAT WILL YOU LEARN?**

![](https://of3dacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Layer-45-copy-3-copiar.png)

## FUNDAMENTALS

Animations are one of the most powerful visual aids out there when we want to present an idea, tell a story and, of course, sell a real estate development. The problem is that the most common defects in animations in the 3D architecture market are in details that often go unnoticed.

The animation doesn’t look good, and the Artist doesn’t even know why. That’s why we emphasize so much the need for a good foundation: what is, in fact, an animation? What are keyframes, curves, transitions and other basic concepts that are so important in this market? Mastering these aspects will get you started on the right foot in one of the most lucrative fields in Archviz!

![](https://of3dacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MOVIMENTOS_DE_CAMERA_001-1024x576.jpg)

## CAMERA MOVEMENTS

Ever watched a movie that gripped your attention so much that you just couldn’t take your eyes off the screen? In every take, in every transition, there are camera movements that are so natural and well-designed that we often don’t even notice what’s going on behind the scenes of that footage.

Within 3D it is no different. Just imagine creating an amazing scene, and losing animation quality because the camera went too fast? Or else try to orbit an object and lose the frame because the camera was not well positioned? Rest assured, we won’t let you waste hours and hours of work by not knowing how to move the cameras the right way.

In this module, you will learn which are the most used camera movements and how to choose the ideal movement to use in your animations.

## GETTING OUT OF THE BASICS

Our eyes observe life in motion every day. This is why bringing scenes to life within Archviz is so important. Yeah, just basic camera movements and “tours” inside the environments is not enough. Think about what is happening around you at this very moment: cars passing by, curtains swaying, trees and their leaves blowing in the wind, water from a swimming pool or a faucet, a fire from a fireplace, smoke from a chimney, lights going on and off all the time.

Here you’ll learn how to animate each of these fluids and objects so that your environments aren’t static and lifeless, but dynamic and full of emotion!

![](https://of3dacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OTIMIZACAO_001-1024x576.jpg)

## OPTIMIZATION

If producing static images can already be cumbersome, imagine putting them in motion! But don’t worry: there are specific techniques and procedures that will optimize your scenes and allow you to produce magnificent animations with fluidity and agility. Time is money, and here you’ll learn not to waste yours!

## PLANNING AND EXECUTION

How long does it take to produce an animation? What information do you need to collect from your customer to avoid problems along the 3D movie creation workflow? How to present the movie idea to the client, before going to all the work and expense of rendering the animation? Make no mistake: to unlock the full potential that animations have for your work as a 3D artist, you need to have well-defined and structured processes.

This will save you a lot of headaches and friction with customers. Therefore, in this module we will help you develop a professional pipeline to always deliver the best result!

![](https://of3dacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PRECO_003-1024x551.png)

## PRICE

How much should you charge your clients for this type of service? How much does it cost to produce an animation? What aspects should be taken into account when pricing the production of a 3D movie? These are the golden questions! After all, there’s no point in having all the technical and artistic mastery if you can’t use that talent to boost the profitability of your business. With this in mind, we’ve developed a specific module to help you be confident when it comes to valuing and pricing your work!

In one week of immersion, he achieved realistic rendering and changed his profession for good. Watch the video to see what a remarkable week it was for him.

## JULIA MORAN

She was afraid of 3ds Max. She thought that the most widely used programs in the archviz industry were too complicated, “a seven-headed beast.” But in 3 days of the event and 2 months of OF3D Academy training, she has mastered the programs and has been able to apply the methodology to real clients and projects.
