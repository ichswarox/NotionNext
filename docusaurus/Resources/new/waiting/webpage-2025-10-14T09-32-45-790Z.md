## Description

This course provides a complete introduction to **2D and 3D drafting and design using AutoCAD software**, guiding learners from fundamentals to advanced techniques. You will start by mastering the **core drawing and modification tools**, then progress to building **complex 3D models, applying materials.** As an industry expert with years of experience, I’ve designed this course to teach you everything you need to know about AutoCAD in the shortest possible time.

You’ll gain practical experience creating **floor plans, elevations, circuit diagrams, mechanical parts, and structural details**. You’ll also learn how to **manage projects efficiently with Xrefs, Sheet Set Manager, and advanced block creation**.

By the end of the course, you will be equipped with the skills to **take a project from concept to professional output**, whether your goal is to pursue a career in architecture, engineering, or design or to enhance your AutoCAD proficiency for certification exams and workplace advancement. **The versatile skills you’ll gain in drafting, modeling, and visualization can be applied across multiple industries—including architecture, interior design, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and even product design.**

  

**Getting Started**

-   Exploring the AutoCAD for Windows interface
    
-   Setting up drawing units and navigation basics
    
-   Understanding coordinate systems for accuracy
    

**Basic Drawing Skills**

-   Drawing lines, rectangles, circles, arcs, ellipses, polygons, and splines
    
-   Using drawing aids: grid, snap, ortho mode, and polar tracking
    
-   Canceling, erasing, undoing, and grip editing
    
-   Blending between objects with curves and splines
    

**Projects & Drawings**

-   Draw floor plans, elevations, sections, site plans, and staircase details
    
-   Complete a full residential building project from start to finish
    
-   Develop sectional drawings and isometric views
    
-   Prepare professional drawing sets and project submissions
    

**Core Tools & Editing Methods**

-   Creating selection sets for precise editing
    
-   Move, copy, rotate, scale, and array commands
    
-   Trim, extend, stretch, lengthen, offset, mirror, and align
    
-   Apply modification tools: fillet, chamfer, explode, and join
    

**3D Modeling & Solids**

-   Create 3D models using solids, surfaces, and meshes
    
-   Model complex 3D shapes, windows, doors, and roofs from scratch
    
-   Use solid editing tools: extrude, revolve, loft, sweep, shell, slice, subtract, and union
    
-   Apply UCS coordinates and dynamic 3D views
    
-   Set up cameras, export views, and manage rendering workflows
    

**Customization & Efficiency**

-   Create custom AutoCAD templates and dynamic blocks (doors, windows, furniture)
    
-   Use Layer States Manager for color profiles and theme-based work
    
-   Convert units of existing drawings with a single command
