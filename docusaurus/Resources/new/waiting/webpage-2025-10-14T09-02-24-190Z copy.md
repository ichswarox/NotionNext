## Requirements

-   Marvelous Designer software. And you. Yes, that’s it!
    

## Description

**Note:** The main difference in this course is that it’s **project-based** and built around **real-world garments** and **fabric models**. Every concept is taught through **hands-on projects** and **professional workflows** that come directly from **practice**, not theory.

-   Do you want to create **realistic clothing** and **fabric simulations** step by step?
    
-   Do you know how to work with **avatars**, **sewing tools**, and **fabric physics** to build **professional garments**?
    
-   Do you want to learn the exact tricks professionals use for **pleats**, **folds**, **cushions**, and even **architectural fabric models**?
    

**Marvelous Designer** is one of the most powerful tools for **fashion design**, **3D modeling**, and **visualization**, and in this course we’ll go deep into its **workflows**. You’ll learn how to **set up avatars**, **design patterns**, **stitch garments**, and **simulate realistic fabrics** for both **fashion** and **architecture**. From the very first session, every lesson is **project-based**: creating **dresses**, **cushions**, **pleated skirts**, and even **structural models** with fabric tension and wrinkles.

**Headlines:**

-   **Introduction** to Marvelous Designer **interface** and **avatars**
    
-   **Drawing** and **editing 2D clothing patterns** with precision
    
-   **Sewing tools**: segment sewing, free sewing, and symmetric sewing
    
-   **Garment controls**: arrangement points, bounding volumes, and posing avatars
    
-   **Architectural elements**: exporting from 3ds Max and stitching fabrics on structures
    
-   **Modeling cushions** with folds, embossing, textures, and elastic bands
    
-   **Pleated garment workflows**: manual pleats, pleats fold tool, and pleats sewing
    
-   **Gravity**, **pressure**, **layering**, and **particle distance** for realistic simulation
    
-   **Applying textures**, **logos**, and **advanced fabric materials**
    
-   **Exporting final models** for use in Max or other software
    

And don’t worry — **this course will be updated again and again** with new projects, features, and techniques to ensure you always stay up-to-date with **Marvelous Designer**.

## Who this course is for:

-   I have created this course for beginners in Marvelous Designer who want to learn garment creation step by step — no fast forwards, no skipped parts — just a clear path from setup to final simulation. It’s also for 3D artists, character designers, and students who want to: Build realistic garments like shirts, pants, dresses, and jackets. Add professional details such as pleats, folds, buttons, and zippers. Improve their workflow with practical techniques and production-proven tips. Expand their creativity by modeling not only clothes but also props and accessories. Whether you’re just starting out or you want to push your Marvelous Designer skills to the next level, this course is made for you.
