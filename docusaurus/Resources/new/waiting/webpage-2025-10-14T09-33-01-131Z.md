## Requirements

## Description

**Note:** The main difference in this course is that it’s **project-based and built around real-world renders**. Every concept is taught through **hands-on projects and professional tricks** that come directly from practice, not theory.

  

-   **Do you want to create photorealistic daylight, night, and cloudy renders step by step?**
    
-   **Do you know how to balance shadows, reflections, and color to achieve realism in Lumion?**
    
-   **Do you want to learn the exact tricks professionals use for cinematic moods in architecture renders?**
    

Lumion is one of the most powerful tools for **architectural visualization**, and in this course we’ll go deep into **lighting workflows**. You’ll learn how to set up scenes, control the atmosphere, and create **realistic interior and exterior renders** by mastering the full range of effects: daylight, night, alternative night moods, and cloudy skies. Every lesson builds toward **professional, portfolio-ready results** with clear explanations and test renders at each stage.

Headlines:

-   **Daylight Lighting** with Real Sky, Skylight, Hyperlight, and Color Correction
    
-   **Night Lighting** with warm lights, reflections, and cinematic moods
    
-   **Alternative Night Setups** using Sun tricks, Lens Flare, and custom tones
    
-   **Cloudy Environments** with fog, precipitation, and autumn effects
    
-   **Shadows & Exposure** for depth, balance, and natural realism
    
-   **Analog Color Lab & Color Correction** for stylized or realistic tones
    
-   **Reflections & Materials** for glass, water, and wet surfaces
    
-   **Depth of Field & Handheld Camera** for cinematic composition
    
-   **Test Render Workflow** to refine every stage step by step
    

By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills to **create professional photorealistic renders in Lumion 11, 12, and beyond**. Don’t hesitate—**ask me any question you want throughout the course.**
