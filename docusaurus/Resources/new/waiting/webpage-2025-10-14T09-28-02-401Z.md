I'm Ava Moradi, an artist with a passion for teaching. I started painting when I was 6 years old and learned different art mediums such as charcoal and pencil drawing, oil on canvas, watercolour, and also glass painting. I consider myself an artist and an art teacher. I have had exhibitions in London, St Moritz, Paris, Seoul, and Beijing. My latest exhibition was for Lightopia light festival, where we won the city life award for exhibition.

After completing my Master’s degree in Art Business, at Sotheby’s Institute of Art, I furthered my education at the University of the Arts of London, Central Saint Martins. Once I finished all my studies, I became a full time art teacher.

Being a teacher taught me a lot; as a person and as an artist. I found my path and passion for creating art and also teaching it. After launching my courses, I gained 10,000+ students and over 4.7 reviews, which made me realise how much of a positive impact they have on people.  I spent loads of time and effort to make this ultimate drawing course in the simplest way possible for everyone.

Whether you are an art lover, a beginner artist or trying to improve your art portfolio or simply want to learn another medium, this is the course for you.

When you learn with me, you’ll learn in a fun and efficient way. I put everything about drawing in these courses, I hope you learn all the skills and techniques you need and most importantly, enjoy the courses.
