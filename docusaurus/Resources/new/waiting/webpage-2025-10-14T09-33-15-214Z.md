## Description

Welcome to the Unreal Engine 5 Blueprint 2D Game – Santa Flappy for Android course! If you've ever wanted to build and publish your own mobile game without writing a single line of code, this course is the perfect place to start.

In this project-based course, you’ll create a fully functional 2D side-scrolling mobile game called Santa Flappy using Unreal Engine 5 and Blueprint visual scripting. Santa Flappy is no ordinary flappy-style game — it features stunning sky visuals, smooth gameplay, and multiple fun mechanics to keep players engaged.

Your main character, Santa, will fly through the air, jumping over deadly log obstacles while collecting coins. You’ll also implement an exciting fireball ability that allows Santa to break obstacles in his path. The game includes a score-based level progression system with 20 levels — after reaching the target score in each level, Santa advances to the next one. You’ll also build a coin system, unlock multiple Santa characters, and design an intuitive UI with menus and HUDs.

Everything is built using Blueprints — no coding required. You’ll learn to handle touch input, create visual effects, package for Android, and even test your game on real devices.

By the end of this course, you’ll have a complete, polished Android game and the skills to make many more. Whether you’re a beginner or just curious about mobile game development in UE5, this course is a perfect hands-on starting point.

## Who this course is for:

-   Beginners who want to learn 2D game development using Unreal Engine 5
-   Aspiring mobile game developers interested in creating Android games
-   Unreal Engine users who want to build games using Blueprint visual scripting only
-   Game design students or hobbyists looking for a hands-on project to publish their first game
-   Anyone who wants to create and test their own mobile game without writing code

I am a skilled game developer and educator specializing in Unreal Engine 5. With more than three years of experience in game development, I have published multiple 2D and 3D games on the Google Play Store. My expertise extends to both single-player and multiplayer game development, including the creation of 'Rogues Riches,' a multiplayer game built using C++.

In addition to my work as a developer, I am an instructor at Artigence Meta, where I teach Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints and C++ game development. My teaching approach is project-based, ensuring that students gain hands-on experience in both 2D and 3D game creation.

I am also an active content creator, working on publishing scientific videos on Facebook. My technical skills include using the Enhanced Input System in Unreal Engine, integrating C++ classes across projects, and implementing various game mechanics. Recently, I have embarked on developing a battle royale game, 'Supreme Survival Grounds,' featuring a futuristic soldier character.

Furthermore, I am committed to fostering the growth of aspiring game developers and have signed a contract with Artigence Meta to expand my educational initiatives. I aim to deliver compelling demo lectures to encourage students to pursue game development. My vision is to create innovative gaming experiences while mentoring the next generation of developers.
