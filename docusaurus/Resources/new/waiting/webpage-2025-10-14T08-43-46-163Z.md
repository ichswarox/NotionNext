BIM

## Learn how to harness the power of BIM with Revit.

Revit is a powerful tool that allows professionals and organizations to work more efficiently on their design and construction tasks while also capturing data throughout the process.

### Better Collaboration and Communication

Revit contains several tools that allow for sharing, collaborating, documenting and versioning that other technologies don't have. For example, BIM 360 ecosystem allows teams to share project models and coordinate planning, ensuring all design stakeholders have insight into the project.

### Model-Based Cost Estimation

Revit has different tools that allow for efficient quantifying and cost estimation that save time to focus on other valuable tasks. Including estimators earlier in the planning stage allows for more effective construction cost estimation among other benefits.

### Preconstruction Project Visualization

Revit allows you to plan and visualize the entire project during preconstruction. Space-use simulations and 3D visualizations enable stakeholders to explore design options offering the ability to make changes before construction starts.

### Improved Scheduling/Sequencing

Reduce project phase cycles and eliminating construction schedule setbacks. Revit allows design and documentation to be done simultaneously and easily make changes to adapt to new information such as site conditions.
