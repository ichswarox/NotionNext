## Requirements

-   I expect you to have basic experience with Substance Painter, Unreal Engine, and Maya.
    

## Description

Do you struggle with turning your high-poly sculpts into optimized, game-ready characters? This course will guide you through the entire production pipeline: from retopology and clean UVs to baking maps and texturing with stunning detail. You’ll also learn hair creation techniques and how to present your finished character in Unreal Engine with a professional touch.

  

**About Me:**

My name is Mahdi Khouei, and I have been a 3D character artist for a decade now. I have worked in VFX and the game industry, as well as 3D printing. Currently, I’m working as a freelance 3D character artist.

  
**By the End Of This Course, You Will Be Able To:**

-   You’ll learn how to turn your high-poly sculpts into fully optimized, game-ready characters.
    
-   We’ll cover retopology, UVs, baking, and advanced texturing to bring your models to life.
    

  
**What You Will Learn:**

-   Retopologize and prepare a clean, game-ready mesh
    
-   Create UVs and bake high-poly details into texture maps
    
-   Texture the character with realistic materials
    
-   Create hair textures and hair cards
    
-   Import and present the final character in Unreal Engine
    

  
**Course Project Overview:**

In this course, you’ll learn how to turn your high-poly sculpts into fully optimized, game-ready characters. We’ll cover retopology, UVs, baking, and advanced texturing to bring your models to life. You’ll also explore hair creation and learn how to present your final character in Unreal Engine. By the end, you’ll have the complete workflow to take any sculpt from raw detail to polished, production-ready character.

  

**Who is This Course For?**

-   I have designed this course for intermediate 3d modelling students, who want to model beautiful looking production ready male anatomy characters but they struggle to get it because they don't find a tutorial which is step by step, no fast forward, no skip and coming from a production artist who is doing this for years.
    
-   The course is also for artists who want to speed up their workflow in Blender and improve their skill in making male anatomy.
    

  

**Who is Not The Ideal Student For This Course?**

This course is not intended for absolute beginners.

  
**What Are The Requirements Or Prerequisites For Taking This Course?**

-   I expect you to have basic experience with Substance Painter, Unreal Engine, and Maya.

Welcome to Nexttut Education, Myself Nalini Kanta Jena, I am the founder and director of Nexttut Education. I have been teaching and working in the game industry since 2008.

I have been teaching here on Udemy since 2017 and have created few bestseller courses. student seems to love my work and I love them as well. Everything was fine but except one problem and that is student's growing demand to create various courses for them. I realize that I can never fulfill such massive number of request to create different courses so that is when Nexttut Education took it's shape.

We only create courses with highly talented professionals who has at least 5+ years off experience working in the film and game industry.

The single goal of Nexttut Education is to help students to become a production ready artist and get jobs wherever they want. We are committed to create high quality professional courses for 3d students. If you are a student learning from any local institution or a 3d artist who has just started working in the industry or an artist who has some years of experience, you have come to the right place.

We love you and your feedback. Please give us feedback on how we can make better courses for you and how we can help you in any ways.

thank you for reading :)

Regards,

Director
