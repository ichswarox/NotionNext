Science fiction is where imagination and fantasy meet and is an endless source of inspiration for writers, film directors, painters, and designers. Concept artist Matías Vivanco Brellenthin, better known as Brellias, has found science fiction to be a boundless source of ideas for his work.

In this course, Brellias teaches you how to create a futuristic science fiction landscape in Blender. Take the rules of physics to their limits, with impossible compositions, and use color, textures, and lighting to create scenes inspired by vaporwave and cyberpunk. Illustrate further than the horizon and turn your fantasies into reality.

    La struttura delle lezioni è chiara e ben organizzata. L'insegnante è molto competente e le spiegazioni sono abbastanza facili da seguire. Gli esercizi e i progetti proposti mi hanno aiutato a mettere in pratica ciò che ho imparato in modo efficace.
