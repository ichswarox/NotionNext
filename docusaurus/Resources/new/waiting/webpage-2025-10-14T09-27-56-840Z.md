-   solidworks part
    

## Description

This course is for those who are enthusiastic about learning Solidworks motion analysis but does not have any idea where to start

In this course, there are two chapters in the first chapter you will learn all the basics and important terms of animation in Solidworks like

1.  key properties
    
2.  timeline,
    
3.  how to change the animation
    
4.  how to use dimensions to dynamic body deforming spring animation in Solidworks
    
5.  fps (frame per second)
    

In the second chapter, things get a little complex. But you will learn a lot of things

1.  contacts (why we use contact in motion analysis, how to define it parameter etc)
    
2.  Event-based motion analysis
    
3.  Different type of motor parameter and how to use it (like distance, velocity, segments, an expression we will discuss everything in great details)
    
4.  path follow animation in Solidworks
    
5.  Four bar mechanism Analysis
    
6.  Torque, power calculation in Solidworks
    
7.  graph plotting (different kind of graph plotting like velocity, trace path, acceleration, displacement, and much more)
    
8.  friction force calculation (How to define friction, how to use mate to define friction, how to plot friction  force on a graph)
    
9.  How to control robot arm movement by using mate controller
    

Before you buy this make sure you know all about mates and assembly like how to use them. This course is for those who have basics knowledge of assembly in Solidworks if you are beginners who never used Solidworks before then this course is not for you

Hi i am a mechanical engineer who love to 3D animation, designing mechanism and exploring new things. I love making new things, visualizing , animating, analyzing. While you guys watching this course you will learn a lot of things like why some kinds of error you are facing how to approach them or resolve them it will help your mind to think out of the box
