## Description

**Resolution free Character Design and Illustration**

Are you looking to start your career in character design? Are you looking for a way to hone your digital art skills? In this course, you will learn how to digital paint in Adobe Illustrator. I'll walk you through the entire process from start to finish.

The techniques I'm using in this video series can be carried over into many other painting applications. The methods I'm using are particular to Adobe Illustrator. This video will focus primarily on how to digital paint in the broadest sense so we can apply the knowledge to any other process as we see fit.

Digital painting in Adobe Illustrator allows you to adapt your character design for many uses and sizes. Since vectors are scalable and do not pixelate when resized.

Just imagine the implications.

**In this course, you will learn:**

-   Render a unique character design
-   how to create brushes
-   how to build line art and texture
-   how to work with highlights and shadows
-   how to develop a value scale with vectors
-   how to make the character design process as pain free as possible
-   and much more!

**Enroll today!**

  

## Who this course is for:

-   Students who wish to learn Character Design and Illustration in Adobe Illustrator
-   Anyone who wants to learn how to develop character design in Adobe Illustrator
-   Anyone who wishes to learn advanced brush techniques

Это не обучающий курс, это шикарный туториал с интересным авторским подходом к иллюстрации. Наверное, мне хотелось бы, чтобы важные вещи лучше акцентировались - возможно, чуть помедленнее в тех местах, где художник использует конкретные инструменты. И на мой взгляд, этот туториал намного сложнее будет смотреть новичкам в AI, потому что здесь нет слишком детального разбора инструментов по шагам. Но заявленная тема полностью раскрыта, я довольна тем, что увидела. Большое спасибо!

I had some issues following along at some stages purely because there were a few basic features in illustrator I was previously unaware of, such as double clicking the tool icon to bring up settings for that tool (I am a fool...)After I was able to get the tools behaving the same way as in the tutorial I found it to be absolutely brilliant. The methods are very simple, but at the same time, subtle, allowing you to use them in quite a powerful way (with patience). I am not at the quality of the video of course, but can see that with practise how I will get there. Honestly, I bought this because it was on sale when I came across it, but I will say this is one of the courses I genuinely believe to be worth the full price asked. Well explained (but assuming some basic knowledge that some people may not have...such as myself) and very useful techniques that you can (and I have) applied to my personal work immediately.Cheers.

very disappointed in some part i had to repeat the video cause the instructor was switching something with out mentioning it. explanation is very poor and so much things that was skipped on. like not explaining on how he colored the character at the beginning .... but there is lots of good new information on using/making new brushes... i would say its not for an absolute beginner to start designing characters
