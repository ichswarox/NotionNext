**Earn** Robux thanks to what you learned and created during the course. Keep thinking about new ways of activating people to spend a little Robux on your game so you may start making a living out of your game business.  
  
**Teacher Information**

The instructor of this course has gotten a slight tick-disorder which causes him to make weird noises in some of the videos which may sound like hick-ups or throwing up.  
  
The instructor has been busy for the past 3 years to rewrite the entire course to remove all of these noises but please just be aware of this before purchasing the course!

Never buy this from 2025, it could be the worst course for Roblox. Resources are missing, lots of incomplete things. He was passing things with some PDFs. Never touch it.

Don't really want to give it 5 Stars just yet, only completed the 1st 2 sections. The tutor is very good at explaining what to do. Very easy to follow. Looking forward to completing the rest of the course.

The Q and A has people who are willing to help and I appreciate that. The teacher is not letting us just copy and paste it so we can learn more efficiently.
