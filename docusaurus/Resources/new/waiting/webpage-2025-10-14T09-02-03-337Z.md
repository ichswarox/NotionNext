## Description

Dear Students,

  

this course offers you a full production pipeline from modeling, texturing and animating a cinematic game enivronment.

  

Dive into the world of AAA game environment creation with this comprehensive course on building a Silent Hill F-inspired Japanese horror scene using Blender and Unreal Engine 5.

Master modular modeling techniques to craft authentic Japanese house elements, including intricate gutters, roofs, stones, wood planks, poles, and windows, alongside iconic assets like a Torii gate and Japanese lantern.

Learn advanced workflows: UV unwrapping in Blender, full PBR texturing in Substance Painter for realistic materials, and vertex painting with parallax occlusion for depth and immersion. Sculpt stunning mountains and terrains in GAEA, then bring it all to life with cloth animations in Blender and Marvelous Designer—animating a Japanese girl in flowing garments, dynamic banners, and eerie movements.

Seamlessly import FBX files, textures, and animations into UE5, harnessing cinematic lighting for atmospheric fog and tension. Utilize the Movie Render Queue for high-fidelity renders, and polish your project with post-production techniques to create a captivating cinematic trailer.

By course end, you'll produce triple-AAA quality environments ready for portfolios or indie games, blending horror aesthetics with Japanese folklore for unforgettable results. No prior experience required—step-by-step guidance ensures professional outcomes!
