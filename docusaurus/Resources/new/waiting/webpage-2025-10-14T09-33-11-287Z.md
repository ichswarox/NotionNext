Through step-by-step lessons, real-life demonstrations, and practical exercises, you’ll discover how to control and shape light to tell stories, set moods, and transform any scene into something cinematic.

What You’ll Learn

-   How to use different light sources effectively in filmmaking
    
-   Professional lighting setups for different scenarios
    
-   Techniques for shaping and diffusing light
    
-   Using light to convey emotion, meaning, and storytelling
    
-   Secrets behind Hollywood-style cinematic lighting
    
-   How to work with both basic and advanced lighting equipment
    

Why Take This Course?

This isn’t just theory—you’ll follow along with hands-on projects designed to help you practice and apply your new skills immediately. Even if all you have is a smartphone, one key light, and a bounce board, you’ll be able to create professional-quality lighting setups.

By the end of this course, you’ll have the confidence and skillset to light your own films, videos, or content like a pro—and make your work stand out in today’s visual world.
