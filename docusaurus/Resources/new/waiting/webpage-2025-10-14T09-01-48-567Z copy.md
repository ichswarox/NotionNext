This course explains architectural Revit from scratch to mastering the program, designed for beginners and intermediate users who want to gain practical, real-world skills. Throughout the course, you will apply more than 10 real examples that cover a wide range of architectural elements, helping you understand both basic and advanced Revit tools. You will also work on a complete villa project from scratch, learning step by step how to create walls, doors, windows, floors, roofs, stairs, and more, while replicating the exact Revit model shown in the course.

All Revit files used in the course are available for download, along with a library of blocks to help you save time and improve your workflow. The course emphasizes practical application, showing you how to organize projects, manage views, create plans, sections, elevations, and produce professional-quality architectural documentation.

With a duration of 15-20 hours, this course is structured to take you from a beginner with no prior Revit experience to a confident user capable of completing complex architectural projects. By the end of the course, you will have the skills to efficiently use Revit in real-world design, prepare detailed project documentation, and enhance your productivity as an architect or BIM professional **as well**.

I’m an architect and BIM specialist with solid experience using **Revit Architecture** in real projects. Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of designs and developed efficient workflows that save time and improve quality. Teaching is my passion—I enjoy breaking down complex tools into simple, clear steps so students can apply Revit confidently in their own work. My goal is to help you master Revit and use it like a pro in the real world.
