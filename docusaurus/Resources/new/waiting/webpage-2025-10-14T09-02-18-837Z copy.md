## Description

Character Design and Illustration: The Summoner. Join me as I walk you through my method of character design and illustration using Adobe Illustrator. I spent over 10 years developing the style of illustration using the most robust vector software on the market. You will learn exactly how I approach my character design and illustration as if you're over my shoulder watching me in a real-life studio setting. My approach to character design is very modular, and allows for many different types of genres and design types. So whatever, kind of project you're working on this demo will get you on the right track.

The techniques I'm using in this video series can be carried over into many other painting and drawing applications. The methods  I'm using are partial to Adobe Illustrator. This video will focus primarily on how to digital paint in the broadest sense so we can apply the knowledge to any other process as we see fit.  

Digital painting and cell shading in Adobe Illustrator allows you to adapt your character designs for many uses and sizes. Since vectors are scalable and do not pixelate when resized.

Just imagine the implications.

**In this course, you will learn:**

-   how to get started inking in Adobe Illustrator
-   how to color flats in Adobe Illustrator
-   dynamic lighting techniques

This course is amazing and if you have basic knowledge and an artist who loves to draw then i will 100% recommend to take this course.i was struggling in creating characters in illustrator; however, I am so glad that i came across this course. All you need to know is the technique which you will learn in this course. After that all it will take is practice. I would highly recommend to go for this course.

I think it was about as expected. I did hop in late in the game and did notice some questions that appear unanswered which does hit hard in an art class... For the concepts discussed and the implementation of a particular style in illustrator this course should be getting a 5 star review. The trick is that you have to be invested and take your own time pausing and rewinding the videos in order to catch certain details and dialogue boxes.
