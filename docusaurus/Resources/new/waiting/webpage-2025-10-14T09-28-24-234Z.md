## Description

**Nomad Sculpt: Solid Foundations** — the friendliest way to go from “totally bewildered” to “I can actually sculpt this.”

If 3D sculpting has ever made you feel lost, intimidated, or one crash away from giving up, you’re in the right place. This beginner-first course is designed to remove the panic, clear the jargon, and give you a calm, repeatable workflow you can trust. No gatekeeping. No “you should already know this.” Just you, and a clear path from blob to believable forms.

I’m an experienced video instructor with 35+ years as an illustrator/designer. I already have top-rated **Procreate** courses on the iPad, and I’ve taught thousands of creatives who swore they “weren’t 3D people.” Spoiler: they were. If you’ve ever enjoyed painting or sketching in Procreate, you already have the instincts for Nomad Sculpt- and that’s what this course is: a gentle, structured start that builds genuine confidence.

What makes this course different?

-   **Workflow based, not just explaining tools.** You won’t be dumped into a sea of buttons. We’ll establish simple, dependable workflows  that you can use for everything you make.
    
-   **Learn by building, not just watching.** Instead of tool lectures, you’ll create beginner friendly models step-by-step that turn concepts into muscle memory.
    
-   **Beginner-safe pacing.** We start with the four tools you’ll use most (Clay, Move, Flatten, Crease), plus Smooth, symmetry basics, and navigation. As your confidence grows, we layer in more Nomad tools—**always in service of the workflow**, never as random features.
    
-   **A Mindset that actually helps.** You’ll have permission to make a mess, restart without fear, and learn in small, satisfying chunks.
    

By the end, you’ll be able to:

-   Navigate Nomad comfortably and set up a distraction-free interface
    
-   Block out strong shapes, refine clean planes, and add crisp stylized accents
    
-   Understand what’s under the hood—vertices, edges, and quads—so tools finally “click”
    
-   Use symmetry wisely (and break it when your model needs life)
    
-   Export cleanly and know your next steps toward printing, painting, or game-ready workflows
    

This is _for absolute beginners_ - artists who love creating in apps like Procreate but feel intimidated by 3D. If that’s you, you’ll feel seen, supported, and—most importantly—successful. We’ll keep projects fun and finishable so you stack wins quickly and build real momentum.

You’re not just buying videos; you’re getting a starter system you can reuse for heads, props, creatures—anything you imagine. Once the workflow is second nature, adding Nomad’s more advanced tools is simple (and surprisingly fun).

And because I want this to feel completely safe to try, your purchase is covered by a **30-day money-back guarantee**. If you don’t feel more capable and confident with Nomad after working through the lessons, you shouldn’t pay. Simple as that.

Ready to turn “that looks impossible!” into “that looks great! I did that...”?

  
**Enroll in _Nomad Sculpt: Solid Foundations_ now** and start sculpting, with a workflow you’ll use for years. I'll see you on the course!

This is a fantastic course. Simon makes learning fun and memorable without the overwhelm of learning loads of things at once. You learn by using the tools in a project, which is easier to understand.
