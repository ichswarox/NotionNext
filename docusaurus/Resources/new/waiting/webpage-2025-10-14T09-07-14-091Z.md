## Requirements

-   An interest in the fundamentals of drawing
    

## Description

Have you always wanted to learn how to draw? Are you struggling to get better at drawing? Often artists appear to have a magical ability to see something – really see it – and draw what they see near perfectly. In this specialist drawing class we'll delve into those seemingly magical skills and learn how to really look at a subject and draw it.

I've been teaching Learn To Draw classes for a few years now with lots of successful results. Through my teaching experience I've been able to develop and refine a series of classes to teach anyone to learn how to draw. In this course I've taken what works best and put it together in a five part course to take you from beginner to improver! Even if you've been drawing for a while you'll find useful skills and practice exercises to take your drawing to the next level.

WHAT TO EXPECT

The aim of this course is to enable the student to change the way they see - to look at what they are drawing as a series of lines, shapes and tones and to be able to successfully translate this onto paper. Each part of the course below covers a key aspect of learning to draw and includes explanations, exercises and a practice project.

Part 1: Sketching and Shading Basics

Part 2: Looking at Edges

Part 3: Proportion

Part 4: Tone & Shading

Part 5: Final Drawing Project: The Eye

To succeed at drawing requires practice, practice, practice! - It's very similar to learning a musical instrument - you can understand all the theory in the world but to become competent at playing you need to put in the practice. To successfully improve your drawing will require a commitment to practicing and I suggest spreading this course out over 5-6 weeks with self-practice in between classes. I'm more than happy to give you feedback on your drawing or answer any questions you may have along the way!

## Who this course is for:

-   Beginners interested in learning to draw realistically
-   Students who want to improve their drawing skills
-   People who want to gain a solid understanding of drawing concepts

Hi, I'm Emily, I'm an artist and an art teacher. After finishing a Masters of Art & Design I returned to the simple joy of putting pencil to paper and just drawing. Since then drawing has become my passion as both an expressive art form and an enjoyable and mindful practice. In 2017, after 7 years of teaching art at university level I started my own school, The Pencil Room, where I teach drawing and painting classes and workshops. From here I developed The Pencil Room Online, to share my classes in a suitable format for online learning.

My approach to teaching drawing is to give my students the skills to draw anything they choose, rather than teaching the steps to drawing just one type of subject. My focus is on changing the way you look at what you see so that you perceive it in a way that can be translated onto paper. Once you can do this, you can draw anything with time and practice.

I love the simplicity of drawing and I value doodling from the imagination as much as realistic drawing. Art doesn't need to be serious, it can be simple and playful. Making art can be fun, challenging and therapeutic and it can change the way you see the world.

Happy Drawing!

Emily

I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It delivers exactly what it promises and starts with the most essential foundation for anyone wanting to learn how to draw: learning to see, recognize, and sketch contours. This is the true beginning of artistic vision, and the course gets it right.Miss Armstrong is a calm and kind instructor, and her teaching style makes the learning process feel approachable and sincere. She clearly demonstrates the exercises that help you train your eye to see like an artist.That said, it’s important to understand: this course won’t magically make you a master overnight. You need to practice—again and again—until the techniques become second nature. Many people overlook this part, but it’s key to real progress.If you're willing to put in the effort, this course provides a solid and inspiring path forward.EDIT: This review has been polished by Microsoft's AI.
