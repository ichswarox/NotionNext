## Requirements

-   It would be great if you have beginner-level programming experience
    

## Description

Hello, I’m Single-minded Ryan, a game developer and digital artist.

In this course, we are going to create a classic 2D platformer game, with high-quality game assets.

  

In the game you will control Andie, our little adventurer, to explore an ancient 2D world. You’ll need to defeat the enemies and reach the portal at the end of the level to finish the game.

  

My goal is to create a visual-oriented course to make you feel like you are making a real 2D game from scratch.

  

**This course comes with a high-quality game asset package, including the player and enemy animations, VFX files, parallax backgrounds (some are animated), and a level TileMap.**

(sound & music not included at the moment)

  

Along this course, you'll learn everything you need to start your 2D platformer. From how to design the level using the AutoTile feature, how to control the 2D animations with the animatedSprite2D node, how to code the movement and the enemy patrol behavior, how to create the close-range attack and projectile systems, how to create the pick-up item and the VFX, how to create and control the game UI, all the way to how to export the game project into executable files.

  

I'll try to focus on every detail, but at the same time, it would be great if you have some basic experience with some programming language. You don't necessarily need to know anything about GDScript, but it helps if you understand some general programming ideas such as how variables and functions work.

  

By the end of this course, you will have a 2D platformer that you can show off to your friends.

  

Please enroll today, I'm looking forward to seeing you in the course.

  

  

**At the end of this course, you will be able to do things like:**

How to code in GDScript, which is Godot's built-in programming language

How to control the player's 2D movement

How to use the AutoTile system with the TileMap node

How to design a 2D game level by painting the tiles

How to create the 2D parallax background layers

How to create the moving platform

How to control 2D animations with the animatedSprite2D node

How to create the attack & health system

How to create a 2D bullet system

How to create the patrol behavior for the enemy

How to create a pick-up item

How to control 2D VFX

How to handle the 2D physics layers and physics detection

How to create game UI in Godot, like the health bar UI & the restart button

How to use the Autoload system to control the gameplay flow

How to reload the game scene to restart the game

How to use Godot's input system

How to customize Godot's settings for your game and your workflow

export the game project into executable files

How to update the project from Godot 4.2 to Godot 4.4

How to load the next game level scene

How to create a Main Menu

How to pause the game

How to create the material blink effect (for attack feedback)

How to create the camera shake effect (for attack feedback)

Please NOTE that this course **DOES NOT** contain any sound and music assets at the moment.

  

\*All of the assets (the tile map, animation files, VFX files, background files, etc.) provided in this course are only for educational purposes, please do not use them in any commercial projects.

  

  

  

  

  

## Who this course is for:

-   Beginners who wants to make good-looking 2D games with Godot
-   Beginners who wants to learn how to design 2D game levels
-   Beginners who wants to improve their GDScript skills for 2D games

Hi, I'm Single-Minded Ryan, a self-self-taught game developer. Before I became a programmer, I had been working as a digital artist for a really long time, so how games look really matters to me. Also, along the way I learned Unity and programming, I went through a lot of the struggles that people often face when first entering this exciting new world.

I will try my best to provide beginner-friendly tutorials with high-quality assets, so you can enjoy the experience by seeing production-level games build up in your hands from the beginning.

I can wait to help you learn all of the amazing things about game development, hope you will enjoy the journey with me!

See you soon.

Ryan.

Great users and instruction though the subject matter feels incomplete. No sound effects, no music, no player power ups, etc.

It's an excellent basic course. The only downside is that it's quite short—just 7 hours—but it's great overall. I hope Single-Minded Ryan keeps uploading new content. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
