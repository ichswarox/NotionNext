**Hi there, I’m Adi.**

In 2015 I got my first camera to capture my travels to New Zealand. From then on I was hooked on videography! Every day I learned something new and eventually, I started my own video production company and YouTube channel.

The reason why I love online teaching is simply that it has been the foundation of my filmmaking career. I learned all the ins and outs of videography online or by self-teaching and I would love to share my knowledge with you! I truly believe that if e-learning is taken seriously, anyone can be professional in anything. I really hope I can help others with making content and creating videos.

_So where are you waiting for, let’s learn and create._
