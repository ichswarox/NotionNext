## Description

Have you ever wondered why you don't seem to understand all the Youtube tutorials you've watched in the past? It's simple, they don't teach you the foundation on YouTube! That's why I've created this course to help you navigate through how to properly use Adobe After Effects the right way.

  

This course is for those who seek to understand the basic foundation of Adobe After Effects. But it doesn't stop there, you'll also learn how to start animating like a pro and creating amazing motion designs with Adobe After Effects. At the end of this course, you would have understood how to use Adobe After Effects very well and then you can begin your journey to watching tutorials on Youtube with a better understanding of how to use the different tools mentioned in the tutorial videos.

  

This course is fully practical and straight to the point. It's for beginners who don't have any experience with using Adobe After Effects and intermediates who want to take their motion graphics skills to the next level. All you need is a Windows or a Mac PC with Adobe After Effects Cs6, and above. (Adobe After Effects CC 2021 Recommended).

This is a good beginner course. The instruction is thorough and is repetitive, but in a good way. This is an introduction to the interface and basic functionality. It does not include anything advanced nor is it instruction for project organization or workflow.
