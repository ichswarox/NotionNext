## Description

Build your first After Effects plugin—even if you can’t code. In this course, you’ll use ChatGPT to create a custom tool, install it as a dockable panel, and launch a plugin you can reuse or sell.

You’ll learn how plugins fit into real video editing workflows, why they save time and money, and how to turn one idea into a practical textures plugin. Then you’ll install it correctly on Mac and Windows, pin it in your workspace, and study a real YouTuber example to see what’s possible. Finally, you’ll build and ship your own plugin in a guided capstone.

No fluff, no jargon—just the exact prompts, files, and steps you need.

By the end, you’ll have a working After Effects plugin, installed as a panel, plus the skills to build more for motion graphics and 3D animation projects, and even offer them to clients or online.

**What you’ll be able to do**

-   **NO PROGRAMMING REQUIRED** — Use ChatGPT to create custom Adobe After Effects plugins (Lecture 2)
    
-   **BUILD A TEXTURES PLUGIN** — Follow a clear, start-to-finish project you can reuse (Lectures 3)
    
-   **DOCKABLE PANELS** — Convert scripts into panels and pin them in your workspace (Lectures 4)
    
-   **MAC & WINDOWS SETUP** — Install plugins in the right folders fast (Lectures 4)
    
-   **REAL CREATOR EXAMPLES** — Learn from a YouTuber’s custom plugin workflow (Lectures 6)
    
-   **IDEA TO RELEASE** — Plan, build, package, and ship your own plugin (Lectures 7)
    
-   **REUSABLE PROMPTS** — Use AI prompt templates to generate scripts fast (Lectures 3)
    

You literally have nothing to lose and so much to gain.

Enroll now and turn After Effects from “I wish I had a plugin” into “I built the plugin I needed.”

## Who this course is for:

-   After Effects users who want to create plugins without coding
-   Video editors who want to speed up their editing workflow with custom tools
