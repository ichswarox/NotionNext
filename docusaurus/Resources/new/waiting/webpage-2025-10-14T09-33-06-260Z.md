## Description

If you’ve ever wanted to try pixel art but felt unsure where to start, this course is designed for you.  
We’ll go through the basics of **Aseprite**, one of the most popular tools for making pixel art, and gradually build up your skills until you’re able to create simple game assets on your own.

This bootcamp doesn’t expect any prior experience. We’ll begin with the essentials — how Aseprite works, how to select and manage layers, how to pick and adjust colours, and how to export your work properly. Once you’re comfortable with the basics, we’ll move into pixel art techniques: drawing clean lines and shapes, shading with highlights and midtones, and experimenting with styles like dithering.

To make things practical, we’ll draw together a range of assets step by step: potions, swords, scrolls, food items, and characters. These examples are kept simple on purpose — the goal is to help you practice the techniques and understand how small details make a big difference in pixel art.

By the end of the course, you’ll have a good grasp of Aseprite’s workflow and a small collection of finished artworks. You won’t become a professional overnight, but you will gain the confidence to keep practicing and improving with clear methods to follow.

If you’re curious about pixel art and want a gentle, structured way to start, this course will give you that foundation.

## Who this course is for:

-   Beginners who are curious about creating pixel art but don’t know where to start.
-   Indie game developers who want to design simple assets for their own projects.
-   Hobbyists and digital art learners looking for a structured, hands-on introduction.
-   Anyone interested in learning Aseprite in a practical and beginner-friendly way.
