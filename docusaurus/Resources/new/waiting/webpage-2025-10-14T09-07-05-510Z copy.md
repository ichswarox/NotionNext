## Description

This course is part of the official curriculum of the online IT school **ITeens Lab** from Japan**.  
**Because of that, this video course is a converted version from Japanese to English.

It is specifically designed for learners with _zero coding experience_—so even absolute beginners are welcome!

Have you ever thought:

“I can follow along with tutorials and copy the sample code, but when I try to create something on my own… I get stuck”?

If so, this course is for you.

Our curriculum is carefully structured to help you truly **understand what you’re doing**, practice repeatedly, and gradually gain the confidence to write code and build projects on your own.

By the time you finish, you’ll feel the satisfaction of **“I can create this myself!”**

  

**Course Outline**

**#1-#38: Foundations (Lecture3-39)**

-   Installing Unity and learning the essential operations
    
-   Basic coding in Unity (C#)
    
-   How to create simple games
    

**#39-#65: Intermediate Level (Lecture40-66)**

-   Adding animations and visual effects
    
-   Creating more polished and complex movements
    

  

**Who this course is for**

-   Beginners in programming
    
-   Beginners in Unity
    
-   Anyone who wants to learn how to write code on their own
    
-   Anyone who wants to create games with Unity
    
-   Anyone dreaming of making their own 3D games
    

  

By completing this course, you’ll not only gain technical skills but also the confidence to continue exploring game development on your own, turning your creative ideas into real interactive experiences.  
  
Note: Since Standard Assets is no longer maintained or supported, video #36 "How to Use Standard Assets" has been removed.

## Who this course is for:

-   Complete beginners who want to start learning Unity
-   Anyone interested in creating their first games without prior game development experience
