There was no explanation of what the instructor was doing and it was impossible to keep up and follow along. at several points, the video went completely out of focus and I couldn't see what the instructor was drawing.

Helpful?

you have to follow the video to understand, it's not educational to say the final result of each course at the beginning! I think you don't have the patience to learn.
