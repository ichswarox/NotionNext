## Description

**Maya to UE5: 3D Modelling Course** is designed to introduce you to the exciting world of character creation, giving you the essential skills to bring your ideas to life inside Unreal Engine 5. Fully compatible with the latest versions of Maya and Unreal Engine 5, this course ensures you’re learning with the industry’s most up-to-date tools.

Maya is a powerful 3D production suite used across AAA game studios and blockbuster films. Combined with Substance Painter for texturing, Mixamo for quick animation, and Unreal Engine 5 for real-time rendering, you’ll learn the complete workflow to transform your own 3D character into a playable asset. Here are just a few reasons why this course is the perfect starting point for your 3D journey:

  

-   Create a fully animated, engine-ready character for video games.
    
-   Learn the same core pipeline used in professional game development studios.
    
-   Gain hands-on experience with Maya, Substance Painter, Mixamo, and Unreal Engine 5 in one course.
    
-   Develop portfolio-worthy work to showcase your 3D art and game-ready skills.
    

You’ll model one of the most legendary characters in gaming history - **Sonic**. Starting from scratch, you’ll follow a beginner-friendly process that introduces you to all the essentials of 3D modeling. By the end, you’ll have a fully textured, animated, and playable character inside Unreal Engine 5.

This course offers over 11 hours of structured, expert-led instruction. Your instructor is a Senior 3D Artist with nearly a decade of experience, having contributed to AAA and AA games for top studios worldwide. You’ll gain practical knowledge that reflects real industry workflows, broken down into clear, easy-to-follow steps.

The course is fully project-based, so every new technique you learn will immediately be applied to building your Sonic character. You’ll practice the complete production pipeline:

  

-   **Modeling in Maya** – from blockout to clean topology.
    
-   **Texturing in Substance Painter** – baking, PBR workflow, and painting high-quality textures.
    
-   **Animating in Mixamo** – quickly rigging and adding motion to your character.
    
-   **Exporting to Unreal Engine 5** – importing, setting up materials, and preparing your model as a playable character.
    

Each stage of the course is designed to help you grow:

  

-   Be challenged to apply techniques independently, encouraging problem-solving.
    
-   Follow step-by-step guidance to refine your results.
    
-   Reinforce your knowledge through practical exercises and repetition.
    

You’ll have **lifetime access** to the entire course, including all updates, so you can revisit lessons anytime. By the end, you’ll feel confident modeling, texturing, and animating characters for Unreal Engine 5, and be ready to take on more ambitious projects.  

Whether you’re an aspiring game artist, a programmer who wants to explore character creation, or simply a Sonic fan eager to see your favorite hero inside UE5, this course is tailored for you.  

Our support doesn’t end when the videos do—you’ll have help every step of the way.  

**Jump in now, start creating your own 3D characters, and bring them to life in Unreal Engine 5.**

**3D College** was created with beginner artists in mind, those who want to start their journey with Unreal Engine or become indie developers. We design courses that have helped thousands of students gain new knowledge and skills. As 3D artists with years of professional experience, we strive to share the expertise we've gained while working on professional productions. In the coming months, new artists will join our team of instructors, currently preparing courses for both beginner and intermediate level students.

My name is **Martin**, and I am the founder of 3D College. I have been involved in photography, 2D, and 3D graphics for many years. I specialize in working with Unreal Engine 5 and, over the years, have had the privilege of creating and leading projects for numerous companies, primarily in the video game industry, including brands like EA, Plarium, Konami, and Square Enix. The extensive experience I’ve gained (often through sleepless nights) I aim to pass on to aspiring artists in my courses, helping them in the same place where I once began my own journey.

If you'd like to learn more about our mission and connect directly with our instructors, you're always welcome to join our community - **Unreal Engine 5 Community**, an ideal place for rapid growth.

As fellow professionals, we're always happy to help, so feel free to ask us questions directly on Udemy or in our Community (link on our Website).

See you soon!

I am a 3D artist with experience in modelling, texturing, and animation. I have worked on projects ranging from architectural visualisation to digital storytelling, participating in productions that require creativity and technical precision. I am passionate about teaching, and on Udemy I share techniques, processes, and practical tips so that you can develop your own 3D creations, improve your skills step by step, and take your ideas to the next level, from initial concepts to complete, professional projects. My goal is to help you combine creativity and technique so that your projects come to life.

The course was excellent. I learned how to create a 3D model from scratch in a clear and practical way, but what I found most valuable was the Unreal Engine part. It was especially useful to understand how to implement my models inside the engine. The explanations are very easy to follow and really helped me take the step from just modeling to actually using my creations in a real development environment. Highly recommended!
