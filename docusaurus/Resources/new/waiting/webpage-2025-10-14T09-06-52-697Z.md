## Your instructor

I’m Rez and I’ve been working professionally in CGI for the last 12 years. During this time I’ve had the pleasure to work with amazing teams on various projects for League of Legends, Valorant, Puma, Final Fantasy and more! I’m here to teach you all the skills required to work on awesome projects.

## STUDENT SHOWCASE

Nothing is possible without the support of our amazing students and community. Here are some of the best works from our students.

![](https://i0.wp.com/voxyde.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jit.jpg?fit=300%2C293&ssl=1)

I’ve always admired sci-fi and magical style works, and Voxyde’s recent courses perfectly match my taste! Even though I’m already a senior artist working with Houdini, I found this workshop very helpful. It provided practical solutions for lightning FX and demonstrated how to composite such effects in Nuke.

##### Intae Jang @jit\_effect

##### Senior FX Artist at DDIP Studio

Having collaborated with Voxyde on many projects, I can confidently say he consistently pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in Houdini. His ability to deliver high-quality FX work under extremely tight deadlines is remarkable. It’s no surprise that his journey with Voxyde has been so successful, and it’s great to see him now sharing his knowledge and helping so many students grow.

I want to thank Rez for the amazing video’s. Creating such a result is a boost to my confidence and skill in Houdini. I will for certain have to go back and rewatch some of the video’s when working on the extra exercise but that is to be expected from a beginner doing this course.

##### YoriVisuals @yorivisuals

##### 3D animator and VFX artist

Just finished the course. I would like first of all to thank Rez you are amazing teacher and even a better artist! I come from real time VFX and this is my first time working on an actual cinematic.

Even though that I had never used Nuke in my life, the way the things are explained is just amazing.

Once again thank you.

I have to say thanks for this course. It’s one of the best tutorials I’ve done, full of tips and tricks for building a complete scene from scratch to final render.

I love these generalist tutorials–wish there were more courses like this one. Congrats!
