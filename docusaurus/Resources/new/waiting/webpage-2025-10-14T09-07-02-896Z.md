## Requirements

-   No previous knowledge is necessary to start this course! You will learn everything from scratch!
    

## Description

**Struggled to finish a game? This is the antidote. No experience needed!**

No overwhelming theory! Just Practical, Effective and Simple game development! From an empty project to a complete, polished car parking game you can share with your friends. No prior coding or Unity knowledge is required. I break down every single step into simple, bite-sized pieces.

**This isn't a lecture; it's a hands-on build. Let's create something awesome, together!  
  
What You'll BUILD:**

In this project-based course, you will create a functional and addictive car parking game from the ground up. You will:

-   **Drive & Control a Car:** Import a car asset and bring it to life! Add Physics with Wheel Colliders and Rigidbodies, then write simple, powerful code for acceleration, steering, and a handbrake.
    
-   **Design a Parking Lot from Scratch:** Build your entire parking scene using simple models.Turn your creations into prefabs and set up the physics for a fun challenge.
    
-   **Create the Core Gameplay:** Script a system that spawns a new car only after you've successfully parked the last one. Manage a 10-car fleet and track your best time!
    
-   **Code the Smart & Simple Way:** Use the **Observer Pattern** to keep your code organized and easy to understand. No spaghetti code here! just clean, logical, and manageable scripts.
    
-   **Make It Look PRO:** Make your game look GOOD! From basic to beautiful using Unity's Post Processing stack and Adaptive Probe Volumes for stunning lighting (no artistic skills needed).
    
-   **Build & Share Your Game:** Finally, compile your finished game into an executable file you can send to anyone and play on PC.
    

**Why This Course ?**

-   **Stupid Simple:** I explain every concept from the absolute beginning. If you can open Unity, you can do this.
    
-   **No Fluff, All Fun:** We cut the boring theory and focus on immediate, gratifying results. See progress in every single lesson.
    
-   **Super Simple Code:** I teach you the most direct and effective ways to code. You'll write minimal, powerful lines that are easy to understand and adapt.
    
-   **For the Frustrated & The Quitters:** If other tutorials made you feel lost, this is your reset button. We focus on fun and momentum to keep you motivated from start to finish.  
    

**By the end of this course, you won't just have followed a tutorial but you'll have built a complete game!**

Hi, I am Lucas.  
  
I’ve worked professionally as a game developer at a mobile gaming company, where I developed features and maintained a game with **over 10 million downloads and 300K daily active users (DAU)**. With **10+ years of experience using Unity** (including 2+ years in a professional setting).

I’m passionate about **game development topics** and strive to make them accessible to everyone. My goal is to **demystify complex concepts** and share knowledge in a way that’s engaging and easy to understand.  
  
I want you to feel that making **games is a beautiful art** as it is for me.
