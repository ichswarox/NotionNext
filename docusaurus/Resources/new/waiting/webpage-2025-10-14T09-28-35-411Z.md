Interview with

Lead Animator Joakim Riedinger

  ![Background Images](https://cdn.day1company.io/prod/uploads/202507/133058-1093/interview-leadanimator-joakimriedinger-us.webp)

Question.01

What sparked your passion for animation?

It’s the incredible way it brings together three areas I’ve always been drawn to:  
**\- Artistic Expression:** The fundamental joy of drawing and sculpting appealing characters.  
**\- Technological Innovation:** The limitless possibilities of computer technology to bring these creations to life.  
**\- The Dynamics of Movement:** The energy and precision of sport, requiring a deep understanding of biomechanics to translate into realistic animation.  
For me, animation is the perfect canvas, where artistic vision meets technical skill and the science of motion.

---

Question.02

What kind of industry developments do you foresee, and how does this class prepare students for that future?

The animation job market is definitely evolving, especially with the rise of Artificial Intelligence. My perspective is that this shift will place an even greater premium on distinct artistic vision and a strong personal voice. While technical skills will remain valuable, the increasing accessibility of AI-powered tools means that what will truly set animators apart is their unique creative perspective and ability to evoke genuine emotional responses.  
  
This class was designed with that in mind. It bridges the gap I often felt as a student by offering a clear, step-by-step demonstration of how experienced animators bring dynamic animations to life. You’ll not only see the process unfold, but more importantly, learn concrete strategies for overcoming the inevitable hurdles and messy parts of animation. It’s about developing not just skill, but resilience, intention, and artistic clarity in an ever-changing industry.

---

Question.03

What advice would you give to aspiring animators?

**1\. Experiment and Learn:** Don’t shy away from mistakes. Failing fast is about rapid iteration and learning through doing, one of the most effective ways to grow as an animator.  
  
**2\. Seek Constructive Criticism:** Regularly ask for feedback on your work. Honest critiques are essential for growth and help you see your animation from new perspectives.  
  
**3\. Become a Student of Life:** Pay close attention to real-world movement and behavior. Observing your surroundings will make your animation feel more authentic and alive.  
  
**4\. Let Your Talent Speak:** Focus on creating exceptional work. If you put in the effort and stay true to your creative instincts, your skills and dedication will naturally attract recognition.

### Required Programs
