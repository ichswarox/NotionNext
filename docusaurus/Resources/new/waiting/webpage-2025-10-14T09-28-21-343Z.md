## Requirements

-   You must have basic computer knowledge.
    

## Description

This course is designed to help you get started with animation in Blender through easy and practical projects. You will begin with the basics of keyframing and learn how to use the timeline, dope sheet, and animation view. A simple collision exercise will make it easier to understand how keyframes work and how objects move smoothly over time.  
This course is must for anyone interested in building a strong foundation before learning the 12 Principles of Animation.

Next, you will explore the Graph Editor and create the classic bouncing ball animation. In this project, you will practice important animation principles such as squash and stretch. You will also learn how to make your animation smoother with easing, null objects, modifiers, and drivers. These tools will help you build stronger control over your animations and make them look more natural and polished.

After that, you will move into procedural animation by creating a turret system. In this exercise, you will see how objects can move without using keyframes. You will also add simple rigging, animation modifiers, and a basic particle system to bring more variety, creativity, and realism.

Finally, you will combine all the skills you learned in a cinematic project. By building a jet sequence, you will practice creating animations that feel dynamic, exciting, and professional.  

## Who this course is for:

-   This course is for people who want to learn blender animation from the very first step.
-   Beginners who are completely new to Blender and want to start animating right away
-   3D enthusiasts looking to understand the basics of keyframing, motion, and the Graph Editor.
-   Students who want hands-on projects like animating a bouncing ball, machine gun, and jet planes
-   Anyone interested in building a strong foundation before learning the 12 Principles of Animation
-   Hobbyists, content creators, or aspiring 3D artists who want to bring their ideas to life with animation.
