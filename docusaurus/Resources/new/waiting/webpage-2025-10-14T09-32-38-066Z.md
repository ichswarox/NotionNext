## Description

**Want to create Blender animations that actually go viral — without spending weeks learning every button?**

  

Most Blender courses overload you with endless menus and technical theory. That’s why so many beginners give up before they ever finish a project.

  

This course is different.

  

We’ll focus on the most impactful skills: advanced **character animation** and **cinematic camera moves** — the same ingredients driving today’s most viral short-form 3D content.

  

Here’s what you’ll master inside:

  

-   **MASTER ADVANCED BLENDER WORKFLOWS —** Learn character rigging, animation, and cinematic cameras without overwhelm. (Lecture 2-10)
    
-   **BUILD CHARACTERS FAST —** Use Human Generator, Mixamo & free tools to create ready-to-animate characters in minutes. (Lecture 2-4)
    
-   **ANIMATE LIKE A PRO —** Apply, transfer, and combine Mixamo motions into seamless longer character sequences. (Lecture 7)
    
-   **CINEMATIC CAMERA TRICKS —** Dolly zooms, whip-pans, arcs & focus pulls that make short videos look like films. (Lecture 8-9)
    
-   **SMART EXPORT PREVIEWS —** Use Workbench & Eevee for instant feedback before rendering final animations. (Lecture 10)
    
-   **LEARN THE WHY BEHIND EVERY STEP** — Understand not just how to animate, but why choices matter, so you can adapt with confidence. (Lecture 2-7)
    
-   **WORK FASTER WITH PRO SHORTCUTS** — Build muscle memory through repeated practice and smart Blender workflow tricks. (Lecture 2-10)
    
-   **REAL PROJECT OUTCOME —** Apply your new skills in a capstone project: combine character + camera animation into your own 15–30s short. (Lecture 11)
    

  

What makes me (Vlad) credible to teach this topic?

  

I’ve spent over a decade editing and animating videos for YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok — managing channels with millions of views and refining workflows that deliver results. I’ve spent years fine-tuning a creative system that works across platforms and formats, including Shorts video editing, TikTok video editing, and video editing for Reels. The strategies and tools I’m about to share aren’t theory—they’re exactly what I’ve used to help creators go viral, build audiences, and grow real results.

  

  

**100% Money-Back Guarantee:** If this course doesn’t completely surpass your expectations, Udemy will refund you within 30 days of enrolling.

  

By the end, you’ll have the tools and confidence to animate characters and cameras in Blender — and the ability to create short-form videos that stand out in today’s feeds.

  

**Enroll now** **and start creating Blender animations built for viral success.**

## Who this course is for:

-   Aspiring motion designers who want to break into the creative industry
-   Freelance video editors looking to add 3d Blender videos to their services
-   Social media content creators who want to boost engagement with animation
-   YouTubers, TikTokers, and Instagram creators building their own brand identity
-   Marketing students or professionals wanting to add animation to their skillset
-   Anyone who wants to learn After Effects from scratch and apply it to real projects
