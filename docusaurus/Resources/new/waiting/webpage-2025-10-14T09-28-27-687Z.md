## Description

This course will guide you **step by step**, from your first line of code to publishing a finished project. You won't just master Unity 6 tools; you'll create a fully-fledged game worthy of a **portfolio**.

  

We'll start with the basics and gradually move on to professional techniques:

-   **Game Mechanics and Gameplay:** Master the creation of engaging gameplay loops that keep players engaged. We'll explore a popular mechanic—the runner—and implement it from scratch.
    
-   **C# for Hyper-Casual Games:** Learn to write neat and efficient code for controls, game states, progression, and physics. No prior programming knowledge is required.
    
-   **UI/UX for Player Retention:** We'll design user-friendly interfaces, tutorial elements, and reward systems that make the game as engaging as possible.
    
-   **New Features in Unity 6:** Explore the latest engine tools that will help speed up development and improve project quality.
    

  

Thanks to our practical approach, you'll be able to confidently create your own projects or apply for a position as a junior mobile developer.

The course curriculum takes into account current trends and practices for 2025. All materials are presented clearly and concisely—only useful methods and real results.

  

Want to improve your skills and reach the next level? Then let's get started with the first lesson!

## Who this course is for:

-   New to Unity: Want to learn the engine hands-on by creating a real project, not boring tutorials.
-   Entrepreneur: Looking for an opportunity to launch your product in the hottest mobile niche with potential for profit.
-   Designer or Artist: Want to bring your ideas and assets to life by turning them into a working game.
