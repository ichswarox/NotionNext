## Requirements

-   A computer capable of running Godot 4.
    
-   No prior 3D experience required — everything is explained from the ground up.
    
-   Some basic programming knowledge is useful, but not essential.
    

## Description

Making 3D games can seem overwhelming at first — but with Godot 4, it’s more accessible than ever.

  

This course will guide you through the entire process of building 3D games in Godot 4, from the very foundations to advanced systems used in professional projects.

  

Along the way, you’ll create **five complete 3D games**, each designed to teach you new skills and techniques:

  

-   **Sky Pogo** – an endless jumper where you’ll learn physics, animation, UI, and persistence.
    
-   **Brick Stacker** – a physics-based stacking game, covering rigidbodies, lighting, and progressive difficulty.
    
-   **Granny’s Capers** – a full 3D platformer with enemies, animation trees, particles, and custom editor tools.
    
-   **Space Ace** – an endless space shooter with visual shaders, object pooling, the strategy pattern, and immersive sound.
    
-   **Quack Lite** – a complete FPS inspired by Quake, featuring modular AI with finite state machines, a flexible weapon system, multiple enemy types, powerful effects, and performance optimization.
    

  

We’ll also take focused detours into **core skills** like GDScript programming, Godot’s scene and node system, and input handling, so you can approach each project with confidence.

  

By the end, you’ll not only know how to make games in Godot 4 — you’ll have a **toolkit of reusable patterns, scalable systems, and visual effects** that you can bring into your own projects.

  

Whether you’re brand new to 3D or coming from 2D development, this course will give you the skills to create complete, polished games from scratch!

  

## Who this course is for:

-   Beginners who want to learn 3D game development with Godot 4.
-   2D developers looking to transition into 3D.
-   Indie developers who want to understand scalable systems and reusable design patterns.
-   Anyone who wants to build polished, playable 3D games step by step.

I bought your 2D course, and it cleared up many core concepts of game development. With that foundation, I moved into 3D, though some parts were still difficult to grasp. Thanks to your course, those concepts—like rotation and local space—make much more sense now. Definitely worth it.

Helpful?

Thanks, Abdul! Great to hear the 2D course gave you a solid foundation and that the 3D concepts are making more sense now.

Richard has done it again! I bought his first Godot course in 2D and it was just what I was looking for. The instructor goes into great detail into what he does, which I love, because I have the need to understand everything that's going on. I'm part way through this 3D course and it's just as good! I can't wait to make my own 3D games!

Helpful?

Thank you — glad to have you back for the 3D course! Great to hear it’s hitting the same mark as the 2D one. Hope you enjoy the rest and I’m looking forward to seeing what you build!
