You will learn how to create a visual effects scene with cinematic quality, integrating real and digital elements in NukeX. You will start by understanding the concept of photorealism, how to analyze an image and its key elements using advanced tools. You'll discover how to work with different color spaces, particularly the ACES system, and perform chroma keying while maintaining the highest possible detail.

In addition, you'll dive into using NukeX’s 3D system to add depth and movement to your scenes, integrating all the elements smoothly. Finally, you will carry out a complete technical review to ensure everything is ready to render and deliver to the client. This course is led by Víctor Enriquez, a digital compositor with over 10 years of experience, who has worked on projects such as 'Ghost in the Shell' and 'His Dark Materials'.
