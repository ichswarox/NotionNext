## Description

Learning perspective is one of the most essential skills for every artist, no matter what style or subject you choose to draw. Without perspective, drawings often look flat and lifeless. With perspective, however, your sketches gain depth, dimension, and a realistic sense of space. In this course, we’ll focus on using perspective to bring vehicles to life — all with the simplicity of a pencil, eraser, and brush.

We’ll begin with the very basics, starting with **one-point perspective**. I’ll explain the principles in a clear and easy-to-understand way, then guide you through drawing an airplane. This first project will show you how powerful perspective can be: just a few guiding lines can turn a flat shape into a drawing that feels dynamic and believable.

Next, we’ll dive into **two-point perspective**, which is essential for drawing more complex and realistic vehicles. Step by step, you’ll learn how to apply this technique by sketching a wide range of vehicles:

-   A car
    
-   A motorcycle
    
-   A ship
    
-   A bus
    
-   A camper
    
-   A bulldozer
    

Each lesson is carefully designed so that you can practice along with me. You won’t just memorize rules; you’ll see how perspective works in real situations, and how it can be used to make your vehicle drawings look accurate and exciting.

Throughout the course, I’ll also share tips and tricks to help you avoid common mistakes beginners make with perspective. You’ll learn how to keep proportions correct, how to control angles, and how to make your drawings look solid and consistent.

This course is perfect for **beginners** who want to start building strong drawing foundations, but it’s also helpful for **intermediate artists** who want to sharpen their skills and apply perspective more effectively. If you love vehicles, illustration, or concept art, these lessons will give you the tools to take your work to the next level.

Join me in this course and see how perspective can transform your vehicle drawings. With practice, you’ll gain not only technical skills but also the confidence to approach any subject with perspective in mind.

I hope this course will be useful for you.

## Who this course is for:

-   Beginners who want to learn vehicle drawing with perspective
-   Artists looking to improve one-point and two-point perspective
-   Hobbyists and illustrators who want more realistic sketches

I started drawing and drawing with a pencil when I was sixteen. At first, I participated in pencil drawing classes. After passing these classes, I realized that I am interested in character design and animation. And I participated in character design classes professionally. My university education is also in the field of animation. At the age of twenty-four, I started teaching character drawing with a pencil. So far, more than 3,000 students have attended my in-class classes and more than 10,000 have attended my online classes.
