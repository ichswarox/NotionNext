## Description

**This course contains the use of artificial intelligence.**

I have been working as a project manager in the field of electrical project design for many years. One of the most frequently asked questions I receive recently is how to design an electrical installation project with Revit. Since I noticed that there are not many proper resources on the internet regarding this subject, I decided to prepare this training set to inform my colleagues.

With the advancement of technology, Autodesk AutoCAD has started to become insufficient for project designs. Autodesk, realizing this need, introduced Revit as an alternative. Thanks to this software, it is possible to design all projects and disciplines in 3D. Although the demand for this program is increasing today, I observed that there are not enough training resources available.

You don’t need to be an engineer to participate in this training and learn the software. Having a basic knowledge of electrical terms will be sufficient. In this training, we will cover all stages of an electrical project designed with Revit, from the initial phase to final delivery. Once you successfully complete this training, you can confidently state in your job interviews or CV that you are capable of using Revit.

Before starting the training, you must have Autodesk Revit installed on your computer. All templates, families, and projects I use in the training will be shared with my students. I also pay attention to responding quickly to any questions that may arise during the training.

**CONTENT:**  
1 - Introduction  
2 - Architectural Drawing  
3 - Creating a Template  
4 - Importing an Architectural Project  
5 - Working Collaboratively

1983 yılında İstanbul'da doğdum. Lise ve orta öğretimimi Üsküdar'da tamamladıktan sonra üniversite tahsilini Trabzon Karadeniz Teknik Üniversitesi Elektrik-Elektronik Mühendisliği bölümünde tamamladım. Lise çağlarımda tanıştığım müziği geçen yıllar içerisinde öğrendiğim birçok müzik aleti ile renklendirdim.

Uzun yıllardır dünyanın köklü firmalarında, uluslararası projelerde proje müdürü olarak hizmet vermekteyim. Halen Almanya'nın Frankfurt şehrinde mühendis olarak  hayatıma devam etmekteyim.

bir şeyi öğrenmenin en önemli bölümü kişinin kendini tanıyarak en kolay nasıl öğreneceğini keşfetmesi olduğuna inanmaktayım. Kendim ile ilgili bu aşamayı aştığımı düşünüyorum ve öğrendiklerimi en faydalı ve anlaşılır şekilde paylaşmayı hedefliyorum.

Oluşturmuş olduğum eğitimlerim ile ilgili görüş, öneri veya eleştirileriniz varsa benimle paylaşmanızı rica ediyorum.
