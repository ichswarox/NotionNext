Hi, I'm James. I have helped thousands of people learn how to develop their own games in Unity, and whether you're a first-time developer, or need to refresh your skills, I can help you learn to make the games you want to make.

With a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a background working in independent game development, I have been helping others to create their own games and release them on multiple platforms.

I believe in helping you learn by teaching code in context, so rather than having to memorize a bunch of stuff you've never seen before, you learn how each coding concept can be applied to real working problems in your games.

**I can't wait to help you learn all about making your own games and how to make them a success.**

So why not start learning to make games with me now?

See you soon!

James

Auch wenn der Kurs schon einige Jahre alt ist, kann er erfolgreich mit der neuesten Unity-Version umgesetzt werden. Das im Kurs erstellte Spiel ist umfangreich, zeigt viele interessante Techniken und animiert zur eigenen Weiterentwicklung. Meines Erachtens sollte man aber erste Unity-Grundkenntnisse mitbringen. Leider beantwortet der Ersteller des Kurses bereits seit einigen Jahren keine Fragen mehr. Deshalb habe ich nur vier Sterne für den Kurs gegeben, der an sich fünf Sterne wert ist.
