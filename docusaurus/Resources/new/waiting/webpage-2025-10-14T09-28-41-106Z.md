If you love simulations, animation, and lettering and would like to take a step into the world of 3D, start creating with Erich Gordon and X-Particles, the powerful plugin for Cinema 4D. As an art director, Erich’s projects for typography and digital lettering have been awarded by the Latin American Design Awards, receiving gold (2018) and bronze (2019) in the Typography category.

In this course, Erich teaches you to conceptualize and define an idea to start creating your own 3D lettering. Learn to use the right typography and how to customize individual shapes, using X-Particles to create letters and build a word.

### Who is this online course for?

Graphic designers, art directors, animators, or anyone passionate about lettering or simulations who would like to explore the world of 3D. This course is also beneficial to anyone who wants to expand their knowledge of particles.

### Requirements and materials

To take this course, basic knowledge of Cinema 4D, Illustrator, and After Effects is required.

It is essential to have a computer with the following software installed: Cinema 4D r21, X-Particles 884, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe After Effects CC 2018 or later.

![](https://imgproxy.domestika.org/unsafe/s:475:135/rs:fill/ex:true/el:true/plain/src://course-asset-requirements-images/000/002/873/2873-original.jpg?1691576430)

New to Adobe After Effects? In that case, we recommend taking Domestika Basics courses to learn how to use the software: [Introduction to After Effects](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/304-introduction-to-after-effects).
