    Excelente curso! me ha gustado mucho el proceso que propone Max. Con algunas variaciones he adoptado mucho de lo que explica a mi propio proceso. Lo he disfrutado tanto que lo hice completo en pocos días. Siento que he mejorar mucho y no soy precisamente un principiante. Pero estos cursos amplían mis habilidades. Este en especial.
