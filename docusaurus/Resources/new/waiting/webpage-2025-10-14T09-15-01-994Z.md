I just finished the TyDiffusion Pro – AI for Architects & 3D Modelers in 3Ds Max course, and it exceeded my expectations. The content is well-structured and covers a wide range of powerful tools like TyFlow, Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, and Flux. What I really liked is how the instructor connects theory with real-world workflows — from text-to-image to 3D-to-render — everything is explained in a practical and easy-to-follow way.As someone who works with 3Ds Max, the lessons on integrating AI into the rendering pipeline were especially valuable. The course doesn’t just focus on the technical side, but also teaches effective prompt engineering and upscaling techniques that make a huge difference in the quality of the final output.Overall, this is one of the most comprehensive and future-oriented courses I’ve taken in architectural visualization. It gave me new ideas, new tools, and a lot of inspiration for pushing my design process further. Highly recommended for anyone curious about combining AI with 3D design and rendering.
