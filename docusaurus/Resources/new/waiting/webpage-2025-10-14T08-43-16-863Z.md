## Requirements

-   No motion graphics experience needed. However, you need access to Adobe After Effects.
    

## Description

This is the easiest motion graphics class I've made so far. This beginner level class is a great introduction to Adobe After Effects. You will learn some basic animation techniques as well as some tips and tricks to get you started in motion graphics.

**In this class you'll learn:**

-   A general overview of the Adobe After Effects software
    
-   How to animate using the position, rotation, scale, and opacity properties
    
-   How to animate a line using a "trim path"
    
-   How to use the type tool
    
-   How to create a pre-comp
    
-   How to use an expression
    
-   How to loop and export your animation to share in the project gallery
    

**You’ll be creating:**

-   Together we will create a loading icon animation
    

**You can complete the class project by following these steps:**

1.  Follow along with my video lessons
    
2.  Together we will create a loading icon animation
    

Included in the project file is a finished version of the class. It might help in case you get stuck on one of the lessons.

**What You Need:**

-   Adobe After Effects
    
-   Adobe Media Encoder to export
    

**To share your class project follow these steps:**

1.  Export your animation in mp4 format(you will learn how to do this in the export lesson)
    
2.  Upload your video to a video-sharing platform such as YouTube or Vimeo. I suggest uploading your video using the "unlisted" option. That way your video will be private, but you will still be able to share it here.
    
3.  On the projects & resources page find the submit project button
    
4.  Share the link to your video
    

**Adobe, After Effects, and Media Encoder are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Adobe Systems Incorporated in the United States and/or other countries.**
