## Requirements

-   Computer loaded with any version of Solidworks
    
-   Knowledge of Basic tools of Solidworks
    
-   Enthusiasm to learn hands-on design with real-world examples
    

## Description

Are you ready to master the design of gas turbine blades — both compressor and turbine — with real-world projects?

This project-based course will take you through **five industrial-grade projects**, from interpreting **technical drawings** to creating fully-detailed **CAD models in SolidWorks**. It's designed to bridge the gap between **theory and industry practice**, making you job-ready and confident in turbine blade design and modeling.

**What You'll Learn**

-   How to read and interpret **industrial drawings** of gas turbine blades
    
-   CAD modeling techniques for **compressor and turbine blades** in SolidWorks
    
-   Best practices for **design intent, constraints, and features**
    
-   Working with **real-world parameters, tolerances, and profiles**
    
-   Creating **assembly-ready** models suitable for manufacturing
    

**This course is ideal for:**

-   Mechanical / Aerospace engineering students
    
-   CAD designers and drafters
    
-   Professionals working in gas turbine or turbo-machinery industries
    
-   Anyone interested in **advanced CAD modeling and industrial design**
    

The power generation in a gas turbine engine mainly depends upon the amount of air it can suck from the atmosphere and how efficiently the airflow through the engine to finally get utilized in the turbine and exhaust section.

All these depend on the 1000’s of blades that are used inside the gas turbine engine. Blades are the most critical and abused part inside the gas turbine engine which is the power plant of an aircraft that gives it the ability to propel ahead.

The gas turbine engine’s application is limitless as it has great power to weight ratio. It is used for powering aeroplanes, helicopters, ships, trains, power plants, pumps, gas compressors, tanks, etc.

And behind each successful gas turbine is a set of highly sophisticated and precise blades.

In this course; we have the right content covered which will give you ample knowledge of blades.

At the beginning of this course ; you will be given a fundamental orientation on a Gas turbine engine. After that we shall discuss about the importance of the Blades in the Gas turbine engines' operation and power generation.

Further, we will start an Industrial Project on the 5th stage blade of the Gas Turbine Engine Compressor Module of an Aero Engine.

All the knowledge that you will get in this course is purely industrial based and this will upgrade your knowledge level to match with the Gas Turbine industry professionals.

## Who this course is for:

-   Engineering students (Mechanical, Aerospace, Power)
-   Professionals in turbo-machinery or CAD design roles
-   Job seekers wanting project experience in design
-   Educators or researchers working in turbomachinery design

This course offers a comprehensive and detailed explanation of gas turbine blade design. It effectively guides students from the fundamental principles of gas turbine function to the practical design of blade profiles for various stages. The instructor's unique approach, which includes hands-on, real-time projects and explanations of key details, makes this course stand out. I highly recommend courses from the Roy Academy.
