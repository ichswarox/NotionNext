Interview

Meet the Instructor

Question 01

What led you to choose this topic or theme?

This theme felt like a natural fit because I’ve always been fascinated by the physicality of movement in animation. Body mechanics are the foundation of believable action, and I love how a strong, dynamic pose can instantly convey weight, balance, and intent. I’m drawn to observing natural references—whether it’s people walking, jumping, or simply shifting their weight—to understand how the body works. By studying angles, force, and rhythm, we can craft shots that feel powerful and grounded in reality. Sharing this approach helps animators build a solid base to push their work further, with clarity and strength in every movement.

Question 02

What makes your class different from other classes?

My class stands out because it dives deeply into the workflow, leveraging the latest tools, rigs, and techniques. Rather than focusing solely on animation principles, I emphasize thinking about animation through live references and posing, bringing more acurate and dynamism to the mechanics. It's about understanding the "how" behind a character's actions and movements, creating animations that feel truly alive and meaningful.

Question 03

Do you have any advice for your students?

My advice would be to always focus on the "why" behind every movement or action your character makes. Whether you're a casual learner or an aspiring professional, understanding the intent and subtext of a scene is key to creating believable and compelling animation.  
  
Study real life! Observe how people express emotions through subtle gestures and timing. Don’t just aim to replicate movement; aim to tell a story with every pose and expression.  
  
Lastly, be patient with yourself. Animation is a craft that takes time to master, so embrace the learning process, stay curious, and never stop experimenting!
