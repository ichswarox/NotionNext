# SketchUp Certification Course: Master 3D Modeling for Architecture and Design | ThinkParametric

ThinkParametric Certification

## Sketchup Certificate of Completion

This Certification Course will cover the software Sketchup by Trimble, Inc. Sketching is the quickest way to visualize complex 2D and 3D ideas, and that's the basis of the 3D Modeling Software called Sketchup.

Sketchup is one of the most intuitive 3D surface modelers and has a friendly CAD Interface to help you create, develop and manage 3D projects. To become proficient in using the software, it's important to have a solid introduction, fundamentals for how it works, and some fundamentals of 3D Modeling in general, especially with regard to application in real world projects.

Whether you are a complete beginner or someone with a bit of experience; we cover everything from the very basics up to proficient use. The course has 8 Modules comprising all the subjects you must learn to understand how Sketchup works and how to design and document your Sketchup projects.

EXPLICIT MODELING

## Bring your ideas to life with Sketchup.

Sketchup is one of the most intuitive and efficient ways for designing, documenting, and communicate your ideas in 3D. It offers a whole set of tools that will serve you from a schematic phase to construction documentation.

### Create your ideas with ease

Sketchup’s motto is “3D For Everyone” and this is not an understatement. Sketchup is easy to learn and grasp due to its simplicity and intuitive methods of form creation. In the first three modules everything Sketchup has to offer in terms of form creation will be covered in detail and you’ll see for yourself how fast you model your own project.

### Visualize your projects

Sketchup has powerful in-house features to create everything from more raw sketchy images to photo-realistic renders to explanatory animations. Everything that has to do with visualization will be covered like material creation and texturing, environment creation, sunlight and shadows and much more. Besides Sketchup’s native tools, we’ll also introduce powerful rendering plugins, like Vray and Lumion, available for Sketchup.

### Document your work using LayOut

LayOut is the tool for creating documentation from your SketchUp model. After you’ve modeled your project in SketchUp you can send it to LayOut. In LayOut you add dimensions, labels, other text, or photos. You then can export a PDF to send to a client or use it in a presentation. The cool thing about LayOut is that it works seemingly with Sketchup, there’s a dynamic link maintained from your model to the LayOut document so if you edit your model, those changes are reflected in LayOut.

### Collaborate with others

We’ll start by introducing Sketchup’s native collaboration tools and the various ways to communicate your model with your team and your clients. We’ll also go over some of the best practices architecture offices use to collaborate with others. Various platforms are discussed to share your work efficiently and effectively with your team.
