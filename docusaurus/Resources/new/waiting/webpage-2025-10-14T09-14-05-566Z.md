## Requirements

-   You'll need to know your way round Unitys’ user interface, GameObjects and Prefabs.
    
-   You'll need understand basic C# programming skill like classes, for loops and variables.
    

## Description

Want to **make game levels using procedural generation**? It's one of the most powerful ways to **create infinite, dynamic game worlds** without designing every single detail by hand.

Learn how to **code your own algorithms** and **build replayable levels** that feel fresh every time! No more designing every corner—let the code do the heavy lifting!

You'll start by generating a dungeon layout with rooms and hallways. Using Scriptable Objects, you’ll **customise layouts effortlessly**, making sure no two levels feel the same. Say goodbye to repetitive level design—your game world will evolve with every play-through.

Next, you’ll **turn your 2D layouts into a fully realised 3D game level**. We’ll harness the power of the Marching Squares algorithm to create detailed levels with only 16 tiles. If you’re a solo dev or working with a small team, this trick will save you heaps of time and effort.

Navigation is key, so we’ll dynamically generate a NavMesh at runtime.This means your player can **seamlessly explore every new dungeon layout without breaking immersion**. Whether you're building an RPG or a roguelike, this skill will come in handy!

But what's a dungeon without loot and baddies? Using a rule-based system, you’ll **populate your levels with treasure, enemies, and decorations**. You’ll also learn techniques to prevent everything from looking too repetitive—because variety keeps players engaged.

Along the way, we’ll **level up your C# skills** with advanced concepts like lambda expressions, expression-bodied members, and System.Linq. If you've got the basics of C# down and want to push your coding skills further, you’re in for a treat.

This course is perfect for anyone who knows their way around Unity’s UI, GameObjects, and Prefabs. If you can handle loops, classes, and variables in C#, you're ready to level up your skills with procedural generation.

By the end of this course, you’ll have a robust system for procedural level design, plus a sharper understanding of advanced C# concepts. Ready to **apply these techniques to your own projects** and build infinite game worlds? Let’s dive in and start coding!

## Who this course is for:

-   Know the basics of C# and Unity and want to learn advanced C# concepts to level up your coding skills? This is the course for you.
-   It's also perfect for you if you want to learn about procedural generation approaches.

I followed the course with interest and overall I’m satisfied with the experience.However, I’d like to share two constructive suggestions:Between some lessons certain details change (both in the editor and in the code) without being clearly mentioned; a brief changelog or version note at the start of each lesson, or a file highlighting the main differences, would be very helpful.For the more complex parts, it would be great to have a deeper explanation of the approach before diving into the code—perhaps a short overview with a diagram, flowchart, or some pseudocode to clarify the “why” and the overall strategy before writing everything step by step.
