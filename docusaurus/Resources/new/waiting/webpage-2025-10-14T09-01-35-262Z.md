The course goes thru the tools one by one. I like this approach. In other words, she goes thru the features and how they are used. I studied SketchUp (book) and YouTube. I used only YouTube for AutoDesk. Such learning is never complete. If I know all the features my chances to efficient use of AutoDesk is increased. This course reminded me of books I used when studying software (in the years 1990s) where all features are explained then those features are used to achieve some goal. I struggle with the plains, nevertheless, some meditation and constantly seeing how she used the plains has helped--a detailed section on plains would help. I am not done with the course as yet. I am working my way thru and now I am thinking to design something other than my original purpose, modeling furniture. I am inspired by her although indirectly.
