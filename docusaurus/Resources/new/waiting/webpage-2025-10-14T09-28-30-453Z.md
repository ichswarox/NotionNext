## Description

Have you ever wanted to draw facial features in a beautiful and realistic way that truly brings them to life? This course was designed exactly for you. In this step-by-step portrait drawing course, you will learn the fundamental principles of drawing facial features and gradually advance to more complex techniques, including shading, texture, and realistic details. By the end of the course, you will be able to draw any face with confidence and skill.

We will start by introducing the essential tools, paper selection, and the different types of pencils you need. You will practice line work, hand pressure control, and how to create accurate proportions. Then, we will move into the fascinating world of shading — from soft, smooth gradients to strong contrasts that add depth and dimension to your drawings. You will also learn combined techniques for creating realistic skin texture, hair, and clothing details.

This course includes practical exercises, step-by-step assignments, and real practice projects to make sure you apply what you learn immediately. Even if you have never drawn before, you will be guided from absolute beginner level to an advanced understanding of portrait drawing.

By the end of the course, you will be able to confidently draw complete portraits, practice realistic black-and-white shading, and create artwork ready to share on social media or even use as part of your teaching portfolio.

If you are ready to explore the art of portrait drawing and take your skills to the next level, enroll now and start this creative journey with me!
