Director, Actor, and Film Score Composer, a graduate of the National Experimental University of the Arts in Venezuela, the Superior School of Film and Audiovisuals in Catalonia, and the Autonomous University of Barcelona. He has devoted his work to the development of historical cinema and the creation of soundtracks using digital tools.

"For several years, telling stories through film has been my passion. I've challenged my destiny and brought several projects to fruition with the support of fellow students from the National Experimental University of the Arts (Venezuela), where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, and the Superior School of Film and Audiovisuals in Catalonia (Spain), where I obtained a Master's degree in Screenwriting for Film and Television.

To achieve the impossible, working without sleep has become the norm. I learned to take on simultaneous roles as a Director, Screenwriter, Actor, Producer, and Composer if I wanted to see the project through. Exercising these multiple responsibilities allowed me to connect with various disciplines: painting, video art, history, and philosophy, which I cultivated during my five years of fine arts studies; soundtrack production, which I developed during my career as a singer and in music school; acting, which expanded my aspirations to the performing arts; and documentary filmmaking, which allowed me to work with a foundation for several years and get to know the faces of Venezuela's most vulnerable communities.

All the projects I've been a part of were the result of the coordinated passion of a great team of actors, costume designers, photographers, and artists who offered their talents selflessly, in a collective effort to bring the cinema we wanted to see to life.

Passion is the greatest driving force any artist can possess."
