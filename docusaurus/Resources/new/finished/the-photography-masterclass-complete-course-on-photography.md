Have you ever found yourself thinking or even telling someone close to you...

_"The struggle is real. I look at other photos and think, mine will never be that good?"_

It doesn't have to stay that way. Your photos can drastically improve once you understand the 4 core ingredients for creating amazing images: equipment, light, composition, and editing.

**INGREDIENT 1: EQUIPMENT**
It's not the gear that you have that allows you to create great images‚Ä¶ it's knowing how to get the most out of what you have!

When you complete this section, you'll understand:
- How to read a Histogram for perfect exposures every time
- You'll know the difference between Dynamic and Tonal range and how that affects your exposure
- How your camera's Tonal range limitation can affect what you want to create‚Ä¶ and how to overcome it
- The first lens you should buy and why
- Why your camera gets exposure wrong and how to fix it
- How to take full creative control over your camera and shoot in Manual mode
- Why I don't recommend Manual Mode for beginners and I'll reveal a better alternative!
- How to get sharp images every time

**INGREDIENT 2: LIGHT**
Although this is the second ingredient... it's actually the number one ingredient to master. Without it, you wouldn't be able to create an image.

Once you complete the Light mastery section, you'll understand:
- The difference between soft and hard light and why you may want to use one over another
- Where light comes from and why it's important to your photography
- How your camera sees light and its limitations
- The 3 behaviors of light and how they can alter what you capture

**INGREDIENT 3: COMPOSITION**
Now that you've mastered Light and are a master of your camera gear, it's time to elevate your photographic prowess by mastering composition.
This will include a true understanding of what composition is and how it can make your images better, plus 10 composition rules that will improve your images instantly.

**INGREDIENT 4: EDITING**
Now that you're impressing family and friends with your photography skills, one more thing will take you over the top‚Ä¶ editing.

Photo Editing, in and of itself, is an art form. Master editing, and you'll leave your mark on the world for generations to come. Yes, editing is that powerful.

I'll guide you on your editing journey with several image manipulation apps that can help you achieve your creative vision, including introductory's to Lightroom, Photoshop, GIMP, Darktable, and more.
