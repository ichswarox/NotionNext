## üèóÔ∏è Course Description

Are you ready to master **structural reinforcement detailing** in Revit through a complete, real-world residential project?

This course, "Structural Reinforcement Detailing of a Family Home in Revit", takes you step by step through the process of creating reinforcement details for all major reinforced concrete (RC) members of a building, giving you the skills and confidence to apply Revit in real engineering projects.

Using a **single-family home project** as our case study, you'll gain hands-on experience in detailing every critical structural element, including:

- **Beams** ‚Äì learn how to model and place longitudinal bars, stirrups, and anchorage with precision
- **Slabs** ‚Äì detail slab reinforcement with top and bottom bars, distribution steel, and openings
- **Columns** ‚Äì reinforce columns with vertical bars, ties, and confinement reinforcement
- **Foundations** ‚Äì design and detail footings with proper reinforcement layouts for strength and stability
- **Staircases** ‚Äì model and detail stair reinforcement, including landing bars and inclined members

Throughout the course, you'll not only learn how to use Revit's reinforcement tools effectively, but also **understand the logic behind reinforcement placement** ‚Äî bridging the gap between software skills and structural engineering knowledge.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Create reinforcement details for an entire residential building project in Revit
- Generate accurate schedules, drawings, and annotations directly from your model
- Apply real-world reinforcement standards to beams, slabs, columns, foundations, and staircases
- Build confidence in using Revit for professional structural detailing projects

Whether you are a **civil/structural engineering student**, a **structural engineer**, or a **BIM technician** looking to sharpen your skills, this course is designed to take you from basic knowledge to applied, project-based expertise.

Join today and take the next step toward becoming a professional in **structural reinforcement detailing with Revit Structure**.
