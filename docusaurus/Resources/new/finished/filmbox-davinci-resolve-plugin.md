## Filmbox - Professional Film Emulation for DaVinci Resolve

Filmbox is a professional plugin for DaVinci Resolve that provides exceptionally accurate film emulation built from empirical data to be an organic and comprehensive embodiment of photochemical imaging.

### Key Features

- **Detail & Halation**: Advanced processing to achieve an indistinguishable match to a negative's soft yet detailed character across its latitude and color response. Reproduces the physics of emulsion that enables film to render detail in ways that are notoriously difficult to faithfully reproduce.

- **Color & Tone**: Dense datasets transform spectral radiance values from the digital image to match the film negative's complex response to light values across its latitude, along with its intricate interaction with print film.

- **Grain & Texture**: Reproduces the tonal distribution of grain across the density of each channel of the negative emulsion as well as structural and temporal qualities and subtle large-scale effects of the development process.

- **Gate Weave & Dust**: Models the subtle instability of real 35mm and 16mm cameras and procedurally places samples of real dust.

- **Expressive Controls**: Simple creative controls that tune the image like analog physics, including Print Style, Gauge, Acutance, Push/pull, Color density, Vibrance, Contrast, Split tone, Printer Lights, and True Exposure.

### Supported Film Systems

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vision3" label="Vision3 ECN-2" default>
Kodak's modern motion picture negatives, ubiquitous in contemporary film cinema. Refined grain, amber halation, with color and tonal rendition that have defined cinema. Includes 250D, 50D, 500T, and 200T stocks.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bleachbypass" label="Bleach Bypass ECN-2">
Motion picture negative processed without the bleach step to trap metallic silver in the emulsion. This boosts contrast, mutes colors, and enhances grain for a steel-toned look. Famously associated with films like Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report. Available in 10 strengths.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ektachrome" label="Ektachrome ECN-2">
Ektachrome is known as a photo reversal stock, but the motion picture version is often cross-processed in motion picture chemistry to produce a wild negative with crisp micro-contrast, enhanced grain and expressive tones.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="colorphoto" label="Color Photo C-41" default>
Still-photo negatives spanning consumer and pro films that define the photo-print look: from controlled tones of Portra to the grit of street photography stocks to the amber aura of CineStill. Includes CineStill, Portra, Pro 400H, Superia, Vista, Proimage, ColorPlus, Gold, UltraMax, Fujicolor, Ilfocolor, and more.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="reversal" label="Reversal E6">
E-6 reversal (slide) films that develop right into a projectable positive. Includes Ektachrome, Velvia, Provia, Elite Chrome, and Instax instant film.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bwphoto" label="B/W Photo">
Traditional silver-halide image-making from reportage to fine art: a diverse array of chromatic response, tonal separation, highlight aura, and spatial acutance.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Version Requirements

- **DaVinci Resolve**: Full support for DaVinci Resolve
- **Adobe Premiere Pro**: Compatible with Adobe Premiere Pro
- **Baselight**: Compatible with Baselight
- **Operating Systems**: macOS 10.15+ (Intel & Apple Silicon), Windows & Linux (requires NVIDIA GPU)
- **Platforms**: Runs on DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Baselight across all operating systems

### Professional Features

- **Bring your own color**: Bypass Filmbox color and use grain, halation, acutance and more with your own color processing
- **ACES & RCM**: Fully compatible with ACES 1.3/2.0 and Resolve Color Management without compromising accuracy
- **Multi-node grading**: Split into 'negative-only' and 'print-only' nodes and grade between them, like a film scan DI
- **HDR**: Consistent across SDR/HDR; simple control unrolls highlight latitude up to 1000 nits with filmic character
- **Performance Optimized**: Real-time 4K grading on a MacBook Pro. Multi-GPU support for blazing render speeds
- **Input spaces**: Supports every major camera and intermediate space
- **Display spaces**: Supports all major mastering standards and color-managed outputs
- **LUT export with metadata**: Exports 33√ó/65√ó LUTs of the active setup, embedding all Filmbox settings as metadata
- **Live on-set preview**: Supports Resolve Live to process log camera feeds for real-time on-set preview
