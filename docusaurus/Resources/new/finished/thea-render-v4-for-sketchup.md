Thea Render is a physically-based global illumination renderer of high quality. It is a unique renderer that is able to render using state-of-the-art techniques in Biased photorealistic, Unbiased and GPU modes. In Thea Render, we have created a compact number of highly realistic materials using the most accurate physically based models. These models are designed to produce highly energy conservative material combinations.

### Installation

1.  Install `TheaForSketchUp.exe`.
2.  Copy `Thea4SU_core.so` from the replacement folder to `C:\ProgramData\SketchUp\SketchUp 20xx\SketchUp\Plugins\Thea4SU_files`.
