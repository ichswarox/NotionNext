## About Hair Tool for Blender

Hair Tool is a specialized addon designed to simplify the process of creating realistic hair for 3D characters in Blender. Unlike traditional particle-based hair systems, Hair Tool generates actual mesh geometry, giving artists complete control over the shape, form, and UV mapping of each strand.

This approach is particularly valuable for game development, where mesh-based hair often provides better performance and compatibility compared to particle systems. The addon streamlines the workflow by converting curve guides into properly constructed hair ribbons with accurate UV coordinates.

The tool is especially useful for:
- Game character artists creating hair for real-time applications
- Animators who need precise control over hair geometry
- Technical artists looking for efficient hair creation workflows
- Indie developers who want professional results without complex setups

Hair Tool supports various customization options, allowing users to adjust the thickness, segmentation, and overall structure of the generated hair. The resulting mesh can be further sculpted, textured, and rendered using standard Blender tools, making it a versatile solution for character artists across different skill levels.
