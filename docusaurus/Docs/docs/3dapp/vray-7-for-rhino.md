## Key Features of V-Ray 7.10.02 for Rhino

### Accelerated Design Workflow with Rhino and Grasshopper

V-Ray Vision enables real-time visualization of your designs while working in Rhino and Grasshopper. Model, assign materials, set up lights and cameras - everything is previewed in real-time. When you're ready for photorealistic renders, simply use the V-Ray renderer.

### Simplified Lighting with Light Mix

With Light Mix, you can interactively adjust light brightness and color after rendering without re-rendering. Explore countless lighting possibilities with just one render.

### Enhanced Final Image Processing

The new V-Ray Frame Buffer allows unprecedented control within V-Ray. Adjust colors, composite render elements, fine-tune lights, and perfect your final image - all without additional software.

### Improved V-Ray for Grasshopper

New live link between V-Ray Vision and Grasshopper enables real-time preview of parametric designs. Support for V-Ray Section tool makes rendering cross-sections easy. Stereoscopic camera support for 3D stereo renders.

### Automatic Scene Lighting with Light Gen

Light Gen automatically illuminates your Rhino scenes. In just minutes, Light Gen calculates multiple lighting variations. Simply select your preferred preview and render.

### Advanced Material Layering

V-Ray Standard Material adds clear coat reflection and fabric gloss layers, making it faster and easier to create high-reflection materials and fabric materials like silk and velvet.

### High-Resolution Material Library

Stay ahead with over 500 high-resolution 4K texture materials included with V-Ray for Rhino.

### Accurate Sun and Sky System

The improved sun and sky system provides more accurate results, especially beautiful during sunrise and sunset. Use new custom direction controls to override sun angles.

### Enhanced Realism with Randomization

New randomization tools add subtle texture variations for increased realism. Stochastic tiling eliminates texture repetition patterns.

### Improved Line Rendering

Global line controls make it easy to add line effects for illustration styles.

### Dirt and Weathering Effects

Enhanced V-Ray Dirt texture adds weathering to your Rhino models. Control parameters let you easily adjust dirt appearance in corners or across entire surfaces.
