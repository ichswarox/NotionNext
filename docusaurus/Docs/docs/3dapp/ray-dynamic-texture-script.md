## The Solution for Tedious Texture Work in After Effects

**Ray Dynamic Texture** is an essential script for any After Effects user looking to simplify their texturing process. This tool allows you to easily add and manage a variety of texture and material effects on your layers. You can store your own texture presets and apply them to any layer with a single click.

This script conveniently stores textures along with their layer settings, including applied effects, keyframes, expressions, and layer styles. Its simplicity is key: after you’ve set it up, you can apply it directly as a texture to any selected layer. Additionally, the tool can store your most used Effects, Shapes, and Expressions—all with one click.
