## Take Your Green Screen Compositing to the Next Level

**After Keying** is a powerful script for After Effects that simplifies and improves the process of keying out solid color backgrounds. With just one click, you can achieve better results than the standard Keylight effect, saving time and effort.

This tool is designed to enhance your workflow with powerful features like the "Refine Details" tool to restore lost hair and the ability to add atmosphere with a single click to seamlessly integrate any object into your scene.
